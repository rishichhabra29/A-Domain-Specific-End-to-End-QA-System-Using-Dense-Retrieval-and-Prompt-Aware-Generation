(Unless you want brands you never heard of) Anyway, the sound and bass is good, I heard things I didn't hear with my old headphones. Also the fit is great, it comes with 3 different sizes for comfort which comes in handy when going to the gym. I went through my normal routine with no problem, although haven't tested it on the treadmill yet.One minor, minor complaint: even on low volume, it's hard to hear what's going on in the background because of the shape of the headphones in your ears. (Basically ear plugs) It's great if you ONLY want to listen to music, but if you still want to listen to the background, it's very difficult.I'd still give these headphones 5/5 if it were $10.Update: After about 3 months, the sound sometimes cuts in and out when the wire changes position.",Is a brittle plastic?,['shape'],[673],[4],[0.],[False]

One day, I was just looking for a new Blu-ray player that had the Netflix capability and Wi-Fi and I came across the Panasonic DMP-BDT210P which also is 3D.  I don't have a 3D capable TV as yet, but I bought this one with the future in mind...baby steps.  I had no idea what to do about making the Netflix work, but research told me I needed a router.  I'd focused on Cisco routers, but this day, in reading the reviews I decided to look at other routers and I spotted this one and read some of the reviews on it and decided to try this one.  What impressed me the most was the reviewers experience with Medialink contact support. How willing their support group is to ACTUALLY HELP YOU.  I've been so sick of fighting with support personnel on other products purchased.My new blu-ray player and Medialink Wireless N Router arrived the same day.  I'm an older person.  I read the little instruction packet that came with the Medialink router, but I was still scared to try to follow the instructions. There are two little pamphlets one for IF you have a DSL modem, and one for IF you DO NOT have a DSL modem. I determined my modem is a DSL modem.  I re-read the next day.  I asked around at work about setting up a router.  I re-read the instructions AGAIN.  Then one day, I just said, I can do this!  There are 12 sections of info to follow.  My computer is NOT WIRELESS, and that was my biggest concern.  I got through the steps and was confused about WIRED VS WIRELESS.  In one part of the instruction you have the option to change your SSID, I was afraid to because I thought you would have to go through the whole thing again, so at the time I set this router up, I did not originally change the SSID, one of my co-workers told me to DEFINATELY change your passphrase from the products generic passphrase.  That part I did do.You get to the end of it, and I found something about removing the network cables which appears in the instructions on the CD that comes with it, but I don't see it in the instructions on the pamphlet insert for DSL modems. I viewed the CD only after I'd set the router up, and found that the CD has more DETAILED INSTRUCTION on installing.  Anyway, this instruction tells you that you can remove these two network cables after you have set up your router and that is where I freaked out because logic told me that if my computer is NOT WIRELESS in the first place, I cannot remove these network cables without consequences.  So, I didn't do it.  It was after Meidalink hours, when I finished my set up of this router, so I decided to leave the cables plugged and call Medialink the next day to find out what I should do.I called and explained that I was not sure if I'd installed it properly and I had a female representative, and she was very nice and very patient, and she walked me through the ENTIRE steps of setting this up and found that I'd done everything correctly and she told me that changing the SSID to whatever I wanted didn't make me have to go through any other steps and she took me to that part of the installation to change it.  She also told me that I was CORRECT that you DO NOT REMOVE THE NETWORK CABLES from the back of the router and your computer IF YOUR COMPUTER IS NOT WIRELESS.  I was relived that I had not removed them.  She offered to help me set my other wireless items while she was on the phone, but I had not yet connected the Panasonic Blu-ray, and my printer required me to have the disc which I had to find.  Anyway, she told me that if I needed help installing anything I could call and receive help.I got off the phone, was able to connect the printer, and then I connected the Panasonic and it was the simplest thing I could ever have done.  All I had to do was click on Wired or Wireless during the EASY SETUP, and I chose Wireless, and it brought up two networks, one was mine, and one was someone else's, and I chose mine, and it asked for ENCRYTION KEY and I freaked out again because I didn't know what that meant.  This is the problem with technology, there are a multitude of TERMS that mean the same thing.  After several minutes, it dawned on me that they wanted me to put in my passphrase to access my network.  And I did that and it was done.I normally watch Netflix live on my computer, but now for the first time, thanks to my new Medialink Wireless N router, I watched my first Netflix from the big screen TV and I can't stop smiling about it!Another thing, I'd like to mention, I DID NOT have to move the Medialink around the room or adjust it or anything at all.  I've heard people complain about having to deal with those antenna type routers during certain conditions.  I'd wondered if I'd have go back and buy other gadgets to improve my signal, but so far, it is not necessary.I want to say to anyone who is looking to buy this item, it is a great product.  I DID NOT USE THE INSTALLATION CD to install it.  I just followed the 12 steps of information.  When you get to step 8 you are given the option to move on to step 9 or to pop in the CD.  For some reason the word (recommended) made me choose to proceed to step 9, and it all turned out perfectly.  So they are telling you the truth that you don't really need the installation CD to set this up, and I think that if your computer is WIRELESS you wouldn't keep the network cords but if your computer is like mine, and it you didn't buy it WIRELESS, you need to leave the network cords attached.Medialink - Wireless N Router - 802.11n - 150 Mbps - 2.4 Ghz - NEW Design w/ Internal Antenna",How is the problem solved?,[],[],[],[],[]

For those of you worried that you need a new amp to go with these speakers, the answer is not really. The speakers are still great. I'll eventually upgrade the amp to get a HDMI capable one for the losless/HD sound. But for now these speakers are wonderful.The center speaker is amazing, you really can hear the actors voices clearly over loud music or effects. The rear speakers are very pronounced, you can hear background noise very well and get a better sound stage. For $400 (at the time of this review) you can't beat these speakers. I went into a BOSE store this weekend and all of their speakers sounded just as good as these, except these speakers only cost $400.The only negative I'd say is the subwoofer is to me, huge. Others said it was small, I guess that is relative. While the sattelite speakers are definitely small, the subwoofer is not what I would call small and difficult to place.Also, others said the speakers are difficult to mount to a wall. I don't think so at all. They may have missed that there are several screw options on the back. (I actually bothered to read the instructions). I mounted my speakers to the wall with no problems.For a medium to small room, these speakers are perfect.

electronics,fast,processor,good,hardware,04a68723c9df59edaa89cd84cc27676a,2,0.6,True,279d1f06f03ffa9a219c519e441ae23a,65294581698883b856d307dc5c9df9b5,B0074BW614,"This is my first Fire, so please bear in mind that I cannot contrast/compare to the Kindle Fire (traditional). I have numerous other Kindle e-readers, and work with numerous other Android and Apple tablets on a regular basis.First impressions - when it arrived today, it looked very sleek. Well-packaged, easy-to-open (unlike reports of the Nexus 7). No power plug, but I have it charging as I write this using a standard USB charging kit. Please note that if you plan on charging this device, you will (preferably) need a USB power adapter that supplies a full 2 Amps of current (or better). Otherwise, the unit will take forever to charge. And by forever, you can just check the FireHD's site out - 13 hours. Yeah. More than all night. No thanks. :) I personally believe that not including such an adapter was a wise cost-cutting move on Amazon's part... many of us already have a 2A charging adapter from other tablets/etc, and it cut $10 off the cost of the unit (or $20, if you didn't buy Amazon's special charger when you ordered the FireHD). By the way, my particular FireHD came charged to 68%.The size is perfect - it's got a good, solid feel, as well. Not too heavy, but heavy enough to let you know it's not a toy. The back is a nicely-textured matte finish. I don't like larger tablets that much, since it obviates one of the major advantages of a tablet in the first place (mobility). At iPad/Transformer sizes, I start to wonder why the person didn't just have a Netbook or regular laptop.Setup: The FireHD comes, as all first-bought Kindles should, pre-registered to your Amazon.com account. After power-on, the device asks for a wireless network, a timezone, and (optionally) Facebook/Twitter integration. That's it. Then it gets to the carousel/shelf interface and is instantly linked to your account's purchases. All my latest books, music, and videos were there, even those purchased earlier today, along with a Kindle Fire Welcome Guide. The device automatically updated itself after the first sleep I put it in.Incidentally, before the device arrived, I had pre-registered to remove the ads, for $15. From what I have heard on other Kindles, the ads are actually not very invasive or annoying, and actually can help pay for the Kindle over time through reduced prices or coupon offers. Me, I prefer an uncluttered and un-advertised-to interface, so I opted out. I think it was absolutely excellent of Amazon to offer this option in response to those who wanted out of that, but I would have been fine with them being there if there was no option to turn them off.Screen: The screen is gorgeous. Here, Amazon has learned from its competitors, who on their tablets used an application where the LCD panel is laminated/applied directly to the back of the cover glass. This allows the FireHD to have a clear, crisp screen no matter what the viewing angle. When I first powered the unit on, I cringed for a few seconds because it felt like the screen was too small - like I would feel cramped. This, however, was absolutely not the case, once the Kindle was active and into all the content, it was very open and inviting. I can only imagine how big the 8.9"" would be!In terms of usability for the touch-like nature of the display, this is the best tablet thus far I have ever used. Even light presses register properly. Many other tablets I've used are very particular about how hard you need to press or linger before registering. And yet, even with the ""hyper-sensitivity"" this device has, I have yet to have it register anything false (wrong button pushes), which are another hallmark of other tablets. Bravo, Amazon.Apps: The fire comes pre-loaded with OfficeSuite (a free version of a larger suite for editing documents), the Silk web browser, a Calendar, and various other supporting apps for things like Email, Contacts, IMDB, and Help. I like that they kept the initial load relatively free of bloatware (MOTOROLA: TAKE A HINT PLEASE!!!). I personally do not like the lack of some applications on the Amazon App Store... for instance, I would have liked to load Firefox or Chrome, but they are not there. Also, a link for Skype is on there but the app is not pre-loaded.Books read well on this, and this being my first Fire, I like the interface for reading books, though I definitely prefer e-readers for eyestrain reasons. It's nice that the FireHD has text-to-speech, especially since the PaperWhite lost this functionality (which I think was a great move; that device is an e-READER, not e-audibleprovider). The three backgrounds should help users with some of the eyestrain for limited periods of reading.I have not yet connected this to my corporate Exchange servers, and quite honestly I may not bother. But it's nice to know that's an option. Email for Gmail works well, with an occasional ""stutter"" to the interface while it's loading something from the web (see my comment in the next paragraph for Performance). I doubt I will do much email from this device, but again, it's nice to know that it's there, in a pinch.Performance: The processor is fast. It's not perfectly smooth, but reasonable. The vast majority of the lag, from what I have seen, revolves around network operations. Basically, if a screen has to load an image, or some other content, from the Internet or Amazon, the device can, and will, ""stutter"" occasionally. I guess there could be adjustments done to the interface to avoid this, but the fact is that to me, it isn't distracting from the experience. Temple Run and various other games run very smoothly on the device. I know it's about to sound harsh, but I would expect nothing less from an Android 4.0-based device. :)The storage (I got the 16GB version) is adequate for what I will use it for - mostly media streaming from the Web, plus some locally installed apps, games, and side-loaded books. Anything else will be on the Cloud. If you're a heavy movie watcher and want them loaded on the device itself (perhaps you would use this on a bus or commuter train), you may want to wait until October for the 32GB version; the $50 difference would be worth it, then.Wireless: Out of the box, Bluetooth is disabled (which is a good thing, don't want anyone hacking our precious new toy, now do we?). Since I have not been able to get Flash, I cannot benchmark the wireless (TWCable and Speedtest.net use Flash). Huh, now I know what it's like to use an Apple product. :) However, all file transfers happen as fast as most other wireless hardware I have around the house, and video streaming of HD looks crisp and clear. Video playback looks clean and the controls are easy to use.Buttons/Interface: I don't like where they placed the camera on the device. I personally think it should be on the other side, so that the camera is ""up"" when put in a case that allows for stand-up (though, this might be my case - but I don't see how they could have easily engineered around it). The camera provides a good, clear picture for video conferencing after a brief Skype test, and appeared to operate fairly well in low light, which is encouraging for me, since many areas in my house aren't adequately lit (hence my additional order for a Kindle PaperWhite :)). The interfaces on the unit are the speakers (which are decent, but don't expect huge bass or amazing sound from tiny speakers), USB and HDMI out (THANK YOU AMAZON! The HDMI interface, ALONE, should sway folks to this platform over other tablets!), the headphone jack (which is well-placed, not too near a corner and not recessed as early iPhones were), and the power and volume rocker buttons.Quite honestly, the only poor thing about the device is the power and volume rocker buttons. They are flush with the chassis, have little gap between them and the chassis, and are the same color as the chassis (black). This means that, every time I sleep the unit or adjust volume, I'm squinting at the top of the Fire to figure out where the heck the buttons are. While it is, technically, possible to ""feel"" your way to the buttons, it's impractical - since the volume rocker buttons have a tiny raised edge which ""announces"" their presence, but they are not differently-sized (smaller nubbin for ""lower volume"", larger nubbin for ""increase volume""). I think that, in time, the power button will be easier to find, since it's smack-dab-in-the-middle of the top, but for now, it's kind of a hunt, especially with a case on. I would have preferred a raised button. But believe me, this is a very minor complaint on an otherwise excellent interface implementation.Here's where the ""religious war"" starts. First off, I refuse to compare tablets purely on a hardware basis as, inherently, a contest of ""this one is best."" That's a technological no-win situation. Also, I firmly believe that, as a technology, tablets (of all kinds, not just the FireHD), since their inception, have been a solution looking for a problem. They are jack-of-all-trades, master of none. They are neat gadgets, but in and of themselves, they cannot do a tenth of what an average Netbook or laptop computer is capable of, and with current price points for decent laptops in the $400-500 range, it's hard to justify a tablet based on hardware alone. And I'm glad that Bezos and others at Amazon ""get"" this - I can't tell you how many friends and family members I know that own tablets, and never use them - because they want a keyboard and mouse.Here's where the FireHD shines. I think that the perfect niche for a tablet, where it can have a chance to be a ""master"" as opposed to a ""master of none"" - is in the singular application of being a multimedia consumption device. When a user wants to read a book, listen to music, watch a movie - they want a simple, point-and-shoot interface. And a tablet provides not only the interface, but the mobility.Conclusions:I feel that the FireHD is really what tablet users should be looking for. We should be looking at a device that provides easy, mobile access to an ecosystem of rich media, with features and accessibility that make it easy to use and enjoy. The Amazon ecosystem is amazing - having been a Kindle e-reader user for years, and now a Prime member with all the media perks that entails, I love how the media I purchase is available anywhere, on any platform. I think this device is a perfect complement to that experience; especially with the HDMI-out and Bluetooth capabilities, which allow this device to be a multimedia powerhouse at home or on the road.The only ""downsides"" I see in this device are the slightly-difficult-to-address buttons, the lack of an option to remove/disable the carousel, a Collections for Books feature (after 100 books, it's tough sometimes to organize things and find what you want to read), and the ability to set a custom screen background while on sleep. Since three of these four are software-based, I'm hoping they can be addressed in future software. In the meantime, these do not significantly impact my enjoyment of my device.Anyone seriously considering a tablet, especially one that takes full advantage of the Amazon ecosystem, should be considering this device. It is solid, performs well, and has a rich set of features that a $199 price tag makes all the more amazing. I think that, for $200, you would be hard-pressed to find a better way of enjoying Amazon's content offerings.(By the way, after finishing the typing of this review, the device is at 92%, which is awesome charging speed. It's great, again, that Amazon doesn't force you to use their chargers, unlike SOME OTHER manufacturers. :))",Why is it a good hardware?,[],[],[],[],[]

I had upgraded from a 6 year old Logitech Performance Lazer mouse, which still works for the most part, but some of the buttons are hit and miss. A lot of the functionality and the like for the G700 have already been reviewed in the comments so I won't bore you with repeated like to like reviews. What I will be focusing on is it's battery life in fine detail.The Logitech G700 comes with a 1.2v AA 1,900 mAh eneloop brand rechargeable battery. It is rated, according to the manual and double checked by Logitech support team, that the mouse can function on a full charge with continual use between 8-10 hours of battery life. That's right ladies and gentlemen. A retailed value Logitech mouse of $99 will last you 8-10 hours on a full charge with its included battery. Ridiculous you say? Well you are spot on. One could easily spend $20 bucks on a cheap mouse on any brand and get 2-3 months of battery life. Sure it would not have the Logitech label on it, would not have the 13 programmable buttons and some other fancy stuff but bottom line you would not have to recharge the battery every day, or even every week with a mouse rated to run 2-3 months on a single battery. So lets just come to realization that the battery life on this mouse is extremely awful, probably the worst I have ever seen in the history of wireless mice. While talking to the Logitech support team they stated its comparable, the Logitech MX Performance mouse, lasts up to 30 days on a single charge. Why the HUGE difference in battery life? Well according to the Logitech support team both mice have the exact same rechargeable battery. So again I ask myself why does the G700 only last 8-10 hours on 1 full charge and the MX Performance lasts 30 days on one charge and they both contain the same battery? What is destroying the battery life on the G700? What drains it so quickly? The Logitech support team had no direct response and made the excuse that because the G700 has more buttons and it's a gaming mouse that it drains the battery faster and this answer was from an assistant manager after I got fed up with the international gentlemen who had to look up every question and was hard to understand. I call BS on that answer I really do. So I decided to go out and do some testing...I went out and purchased the Logitech MX Performance mouse so I could compare the two. I also decided to purchase a pack of eneloop 1.2v 2700 mAh to see if truly this G700 really has an awful battery life or I just got a bad battery. In theory I should be able to get roughly 4 more hours of battery life with an extra 800 mAh if this battery truly only has a running battery time of 8-10 hours on a single charge using its stock battery giving me an estimated run time of 12-14 hours. After further testing the Logitech MX Revoltuoin triumphs the G700 in battery life by far using the eneloop 1.2v 2700 mAh on both mice. So again the question remains why does the G700 chew and spit out battery life in a matter of hours VS the MX Revolution lasts a full month on a single charge? I did some research and found that gaming mice naturally have a higher polling rate (ping rate) and they just hog battery juice from their internals because they require more power for more precision and less lag time. Plus gaming mice are for the most part are wired, not wireless and there are reasons for that because of the power gaming mice require to function at their best. What does this gibberish polling rate mean? Basically speaking its how many times your G700 talks to your computer. For example if your polling rate is set to 1000Hz then your G700 is updated every 1 millisecond. That means your G700 and your computer talk 1000 times per second. That's a lot of talking which means a heavy load on your battery. However if you change it to the lowest setting for the G700 which is 125Hz then your G700 only updates every 8 milliseconds which is 125 times per second which is a lot less talking which means less battery consumption. What does this all mean to the average user? Well if your not a hardcore gamer where every millisecond counts on your life then your in luck and should be able to get up to a couple days of battery life on a single charge depending on your average usage. Please note the below instructions are for getting the longest battery life out of your G700 and may not be up to snuff with your gaming needs. Here is how to do it...1. When your G700 is NOT in use toggle the On/Off switch underneath it to ""OFF."" This way your G700 is not always trying to ping your computer even if it is not being used.2. Install the Logitech Gaming Software for your G700 from the Logitech website and set some settings. Set the polling rate to 125Hz. This is the best setting for using less battery juice. Also set the ""Advanced"" settings to ""Power Save"" which will put your mouse to sleep quicker when idle resulting in less consumption of battery juice in case you forgot to toggle your On/Off switch.3. Get a better mAh battery. Logitech threw in a common 1,900 mAh battery which is normal but stupid on their part since the gaming mouse beats it's battery to a pulp. Go out and upgrade your battery to a 2,700 mAh battery. For those who don't know mAh is basically the capacity of your battery. In most cases the higher the mAh the more capacity on name brands minus some fine fine details. However If you go and buy a higher mAh with Chinese writing all over it on some shady website chances are it's a cheap imitation and like all cheap imitations they are...well cheap and expect them to work half as good or less than a name brand.Because of the below average support from the Logitech support team as well as the lesser capacity battery included where a higher capacity battery was obviously needed I took away 2 stars. I would of taken 3 stars off if I had paid the full retail price but I was able to price match Amazon.com at my local retail store and got it to a more reasonable and comfortable price. I hope my review educated you and most importantly helped you achieve greater battery life then you ever thought possible on your Logitech G700 Gaming Mouse.

Going in, I knew it wouldn't be a pure Android ecosystem nor would it have the latest in hardware. I looked at the Google Nexus 7 (Asus) and a Google Nexus 10 as well as the Asus Transformer tablets. The positive aspects of those tablets mainly focus on the Android operating system. Since I'm a fairly heavy consumer of Amazon products and services, the Kindle Fire HD (KFHD) isn't a bad choice.It's easy to navigate, although the Carousel is rather annoying than useful. I prefer Android Ice Cream Sandwich or Jelly Bean as it allows far more flexibility and customization. That said, KFHD 7.2.3 is actually based on Android Ice Cream Sandwich, according to Antutu Benchmarks.The Silk Web Browser works much like any other Android browser, and the Kindle Fire integrates seamlessly with your Amazon Cloud services (books, music, movies, etc...) As a Prime member, I can also watch Prime movies in HD. For some unknown reason, Amazon does not allow Prime movies to be played in HD if using a PC - only devices such as the Roku, PS3, Xbox 360, and Kindle Fire allow playback in HD.The KFHD has a micro-USB and micro-HDMI port, with 3 buttons on the side for volume and power. I have a Belkin Chambray case that I first used, but it made the KFHD look and feel cheap. There are lots of cases on the market that use straps to hold the KFHD in place, and then another elastic strap to keep the cover in place. That just looks and feels cheesy. I opted to buy the Amazon KFHD leather case that uses the magnetic closure system. It is perfect! The magnetic flap is exactly what I was looking for! In addition, the buttons work perfectly through the case.The experience of watching a movie on the 7"" screen isn't that great. I prefer watching movies on a larger TV. I also found that reading a book on the KFHD hurt my eyes almost immediately. The lighter background on a LCD causes more strain than the e-ink/pearl screen on the Kindle Touch/Paperwhite. So essentially the KFHD is really more useful for reading magazines, browsing the web, playing games, and perhaps watching a movie/listening to music on the go.The KFDH 7"" has a dual-core 1.2 GHz processor with only 1GB of RAM. I can detect that it is slower than my Samsung Galaxy S3 (1.5 GHz dual-core with 2GB RAM), as it scores only about 6,500 points in Antutu while my Galaxy S3 is at 11,000 points. The screen on the KFHD is crisp. I am able to read magazines using Zinio. In the full page view, the text can be too small although it is good enough for me to skim to find interesting articles.Speaking of Zinio, the Amazon Appstore is probably the sorriest excuse for a marketplace that I've seen. Google Play has far more updated apps. The same apps in the Amazon Appstore are sometimes outdated by several generations, or they simply aren't in the Appstore. I had to sideload Zinio onto my KFHD.I opted to use a regular USB charger, and it takes awhile to fully charge the battery. However, in standby mode it sips power. Another good aspect with the Amazon Onyx case is that the magnetic closure puts the Kindle to sleep (or rather turns off the screen) when the cover is closed without having to do anything else. The battery life is acceptable - the screen is what uses the most power.Overall: 4/5 stars. I have to admit that it is overpriced for what it is, there are better Android-powered tablets (Nexus 7) at the same price point with more hardware power. The Amazon Appstore is sorely lacking compared to Google Play. The 1.2 GHz processor is fairly slow, and there's only 1 GB RAM. The lack of a SD card slot is also a mistake. If you want to read magazines without ever having to zoom in, the KFHD 8.9"" or a 10"" tablet is the answer, but I felt the 7"" is suitable because it is smaller, lighter, and easier to handle.Bottom line is that if you're interested primarily in Amazon content, the Kindle Fire HD is for you. The 8.9"" is best for reading magazines but the 7"" suits me fine. If you plan to root the KFHD, you're better off just buying an Android Tablet like the Nexus 7. The Nexus 7 and other tablets have better hardware (more RAM, faster processor, SD card slot, etc...)",How time does the battery last?,[],[],[],[],[]

I can say if you don't really need 1080p then there's really no need to get the newer version. Only a few sources at this point are 1080p. The iTunes store is the main source where you will greatly benefit from the 1080p. There are quite a few tv shows and movies in 1080p in the iTunes store to rent or buy. If your buying this device for 1080p on Netflix then there still aren't that many movies or tv shows. Also it's very hard to find which ones are 1080p.  Unlike the iTunes store which has icons for HD which means 720p and other icons for 1080p. The Netflix app only has icons for standard definition and HD. From my experience Netflix streaming had very bad picture quality.  The picture seemed to be artifacted and pixelated even with HD content. I had no issues with same content on my apple tv 2 or any of my other netlix devices on my 32mbps connection. I'm guessing that my apple tv 3 was defective as I haven't heard complaints of my issues. There are many threads on macrumor forums and apple discussions forums about the same issue. From my experience the picture quality was only bad on Netflix. Regardless of my issues I still feel the apple tv 3 is not up to par with other streaming devices.  Just about any streaming device (gaming consoles, blu ray players and media boxes) offer many more options in terms of services). In addition alot of them are cheaper or at the same price of the apple tv3. The newer apple tv does has have a faster processor and more RAM than the previous version. The only way to get apps and more streaming services on your apple tv 3 is to use air play with either an iPad , iPhone or iPod touch. At this point there is no jailbreak available on the apple tv 3. I didn't notice a difference in performance on the newer apple tv 3. Also I personally didn't notice a difference in picture quality between my apple tv 2 and 3. If you already have an apple tv 2 then I don't think you need to upgrade to the newer one. Also if you are considering an apple tv at this time and don't have tv that is 46 inches or larger I would strongly recommend looking at getting a refurbished apple tv 2 for $69 directly from appple. I decided the return my apple tv 3 and just get the refurbished older model. It's cheaper, easier to jailbreak and still has the great features and interface.I still find the aplle tv 3 overpriced when compared to other streaming devices that it competes with.

After weeks of messing around with the setup, I have never been able to keep a solid wireless connection going with this thing, and I've tested it with 3 different computers (two PC laptops running Windows 7 and one Macbook Pro, an iPad, and two iPhone 4's.  I asked to return this item but Medialink would not accept returns after 30 days.  They offered to replace the router and even the 2nd one they sent me was unstable.  I wouldn't have written a bad review if they had let me return the item, but now that I'm stuck with a $50 paperweight I felt the need to write one to warn other potential customers.After spending way too much time with trying to get the router to work, I ended up going back to my Linksys Wireless-G router.  I get higher speeds with the old Linksys with a stable connection.  Originally I wanted to go with a Wireless-N router for additional range but I'd much rather have a stable connection with slightly less range than a crappy connection with more range.After reading some of the comments on the very positive glowing reviews, I'm a little wary about the actual reviewers of this item.  Looking at some of the top reviews, their first reviewed item was this Medialink router.  To me that should have been a huge red flag, but I was blinded by the $50 price tag for a wireless-N router.  I hope you do some research and look at the top reviews and see what else they've reviewed.  A legitimate reviewer would probably have many items reviewed, and the Medialink wouldn't be the first product!Also, I should mention I was also blinded by the bright blue lights on this router.  They are WAY TOO BRIGHT!  Much brighter than the lights on anything else (i.e. cable modem, AV receiver, PS3, DVR, etc.  I had to put a piece of black electrical tape just to make it bearable.---Edit 10/13/2011:  After contacting Mediabridge as a last ditch effort I was surprised that they were so accommodating.  I told them that I already had a replacement router sent to me and I still had issues.  They were willing to grant me a full refund even though I was well outside their normal return window.  Maybe I was just extremely unlucky and got 2 defective routers but I don't want to spend anymore time trying to get this product to work for me.

The headset itself is also a bit heavy, so if you plan on leaning forward with them on, be ready to keep them from sliding off your head.

I have been thinking about getting a tablet for each of my daughters and have been reading reviews and checking out every device I can get my hands on.  I know I didn't want the el-cheepo tablets you can get for $99.  I've seen those and checked them out and they are tablets, but generally have older operating system, lack support, and don't support all the apps.  I didn't want a limited device.  I also didn't want to spend $350 per device either.  I have heard of people that got the Kindles and were very happy with them so I decided to take a chance and get 2 of them.  For the price of the refurb devices, with a percentage off e-coupon that I had, plus using my amazon points from my Amazon credit card, I was able to basically get 2 of these for the price of one.  I set my expectations a bit low because I didn't think of them as full tablets, but I'm happy to report I was rather wrong in that area.  I was very, very impressed with the Kindle Fire HD 7 inch tablet.  I have a full 10 inch Acer Iconia tablet that I like and my kids like but it's a bit large for them.  This is the perfect size and feels so good in the hands.  The screen is very clear, and the sound these things produce is just amazing.  I couldn't believe how amazing the sound on these is, and how loud!  My kids are getting them for Christmas and I can't wait to see their jaws hit the ground!  Amazon uses a custom interface for the Android OS, but it doesn't make it any less functional. It is a bit different getting used to compared with the standard Android interface, but it works fine.  It was able to do pretty much whatever I wanted to do with it.  Once you get used to the different interface, it's just as easy to get around in it as anything else, and if it's your first exposure to the world of tablet devices, I think it would be much easier to learn and get comfortable with.  I can't be happier with these things and actually, even though I have a 10 inch tablet, I'm very much considering getting one of these for me too.  I like it that much.Now, as for the refurbished part, don't be afraid of that word.  I get refurb stuff all the time and so far, here's what my experience is... they are great!  It seems like the refurb items have had all the bugs worked out and have had more rigorous testing than the new devices.  I've had plenty of new things stop working on me and had to get them replaced or repaired, but I've never had one single refurb device have any issue at all... ever (knock on wood!!).  These had no signs of ever having been used.  Not one single scratch or blemish, and Amazon's support is growing to be legend.  They want people to be happy with their purchases and will go the extra mile to ensure you are, so the support they offer is very good.I guess the bottom line is, if you are looking to get a tablet to start into the tablet world, or want something for the kids, then you have to consider this.  The price is excellent and it's a great tablet.  You won't be dissapointed.",How was the customer support?,['INCREDIBLE' 'This is the perfect size'],[   9 1141],[1 1],[0.9 0.9],[ True  True]

I am not new to photography and the peripherals that go with the business, I use to be in the video field, filming weddings,parties and everything else a customer needed. I decided to get into photography and extend my love for this media. I have been looking at numerous cameras including Canon, Nikon and a few others, I even thought about getting a full-frame camera but my budget thought otherwise. I scoured the reviews on said cameras and finally put my money down on the Canon Eos 7D. Boy am I glad I did! This fine instrument of art really shines. When you first pick it up you can feel the quality,the camera is laid out to make it easy for you to do your job. I purchased the kit with the 28-135 IS USM lens. I am still learning this fine camera but so far it has been a breeze to get to know, The menu is very imformative and if you know absolutely nothing about cameras you can start out by putting this in ""Full Automatic Mode"" The camera will make all the settings for you (iso,aperture n so on)but the fun begins when you open this beast up and put it into manual mode, go ahead and try it, the only way you will learn your camera is by trying different options in manual mode. After playing with it you will know this camera and come to love what it can do. Want to fire several photo's in rapid sucession? the 7d does it very fast and with no problem . . . .however, in order to do this you need a fast memory card. I purchased a card with 60mb speed and this gives me plenty of power to let the 7d open-up and come to life! I will give a more detailed review in about 6months. But if you are like I was and trying to figure out which camera to get I can only tell you that this camera is better than I thought it would be, easy to use and a heck of a lot of fun. It takes beautiful pictures with outstanding detail and clarity, and since it is a Canon product you know it is a quality camera. Just ask the pro's!",How is the learn curve?,[],[],[],[],[]

Right away, I noticed the range and speed were lower than what I was used to with the WRT45G. My wireless laptop would get 4-5 bars connection strength with the WRT45G, with the E1200 I get 3-4 at most. My download speed fell 6 Mbps (!) according to the speedtest website, though my upload speed was unaffected - I don't download a terrible large amount of stuff or run multiple internet reliant applications at once so this does not have too much impact on me personally at the moment, but it might concern me over time if I increase my internet usage and the speed loss becomes an issue. I know the loss in speed is due to the new router since when I reconnected my old router the speed went back up. There might be settings to ""tweak"" that would improve the speed, but I am admittedly not particularly tech-savvy, and as far as connecting routers go, I follow the basic instructions and leave it at that since it seems to have worked for me that way all these years. The E1200 also runs warmer than my WRT45G. The temperature is not enough to concern me about being ""too"" warm, but it is noticeable, vs what I would call the ""not worth noticing"" temperature the WRT45G used to run at. The E1200 is actually the piece running warmest out of all my Internet devices (Cisco CM100 modem, OBi110) I leave on 24/7.The only real advantage the E1200 has for me over the WRT45G is the appearance. It is nearly 1/2 as thick and much more appealing to look at without the antennae and sleek black exterior. The E1200 router has worked steadily without issues, but since I don't need to worry about appearance so much since I stick all my devices where they can't be seen, I would rather stick to the old WRT45G.One word of advice for when you're setting up the router for the very first time - make sure not to plug the router in and/or connect any cables until you get to the screen (after inserting setup CD and launching) where it tells you to do so.. I jumped the gun and went into it with the router already plugged in and every time the setup would error out. It took me a few times to realize I had to have it unplugged, etc for it to setup correctly (need to practice more patience ^_^;).",How is the service performance?,[],[],[],[],[]

However, there were three things that I thought needed improvement: the keyboard, the screen, and storage. In each case, my thought was that they could be a bit larger (but not too large-after all, the main appeal of the EEE PC netbooks is their small size). The EEE PC 1000H provides those improvements and more-and for only a bit more than I paid for my first EEE PC.The main virtue of the EEE PC 1000 H is its small size and light weight. While it is larger than my 4G, it is considerably smaller and lighter than my iBook (dimensions and weight are given below). In practical terms, it fits easily into my rather over-stuffed backpack and does not add noticeably to its weight.  Naturally, if small size is of critical importance, Asus does make even smaller netbooks, such as the 4G and more recent versions.While small size is important, it is really not very useful to have a PC that is too small to use comfortably. While my 4G was quite usable, the 1000H is, from my standpoint, an ideal size. The keyboard is smaller than that of a typical laptop, but the key design and size allows for easy typing-much more so than the 4G. With the 4G I tended to just use one finger typing. With the 1000h I can type normally. The screen is also larger, allowing for easier viewing of documents. Of course, with a height of only 600 it does still impose some limits. I found the screen to be high quality-sharp and responsive. There is also a VGA output, in case you want to attach it to an external monitor.My 4G had a 4 GB SSD drive while my 1000H has a 160 GB HD. The downside of the standard hard drive is that it has moving parts and is a bit slower in booting up relative to the SSD. On the plus side, it has far greater capacity. The 4GB on the 4G was enough for the Linux OS and the base applications, but I had to rely on SD cards and USB keys for extra storage. The 1000H does have the SD reader and plenty of USB ports, but it has considerable storage space. Oddly, the hard drive is partitioned and mounts as two volumes (there are are also hidden volumes as well).While I did not buy a netbook for speed, my 1000H is quite responsive, even running Windows XP. I did not try any recent games, but it runs Starcraft and Diablo II just fine. Microsoft Office was also quite snappy. Overall, most users will find it quite adequate for their needs. Obviously, if you ant to play the latest games or edit video, you will want a laptop with more power. But, it does give a lot of power for the cost.For a low price netbook, it does pack in quite a few extras that you'd expect to only see on something a bit higher up the food chain. These include ethernet, multiple USB 2.0 ports, wireless N, and bluetooth. Everything worked well-it connected to my wireless N network without a hitch. I'm not a big fan of Bluetooth, but it is nice to have that option.It ships with fairly minimal software-mostly just the OS, some very basic utilities and a trial of Office 2007. I actually see this a plus-I hate pulling crapware off my PC and would rather have a nice, clean system. I did consider installing Ubuntu, but decided to stick with XP so I could run Office, Starcraft, Diablo II, and my windows based grading program. Yes, I could probably get everything going in WINE, but I decided to just keep things simple. Besides, my 4G is running Linux.Asus claims that the battery will last for 9.5 hours. I haven't put that to the test, but it is nice to have long battery life. After all, the main point of getting a netbook is so you can easily have it with you. Good battery life is part of this.Mine came with a basic soft case, but I bought a more robust one. If you plan to toss yours into a backpack or travel with it, I'd suggest a case upgrade.Overall, the 1000H is an excellent little machine. If you are looking for a travel laptop, an inexpensive laptop, or one to use at school, this is a great choice. I plan to use mine for both travel (once I can travel again) and at school. My backpack always seems to be packed with notes, student papers, records, my lunch, a water bottle and various other things-so small and light netbook is ideal. I did like my 4G a great deal, but it was just a bit too small for typing and easily entering grades. Hence, I mainly just used it when traveling. But, the 1000H is as comfortable to use as a normal laptop and hence I plan to get much more use from it.So, should you get one? My experience has been that most people tend to over buy when it comes to laptops. That is, they get a machine that far exceeds their needs. After all, surfing the web, doing an email and doing word processing do not take that much power. The 1000H provides more than enough power to do all that and at a very low price (well under $400). Naturally, I'd suggest trying one in person to see if you like the keyboard and screen size; but I think that most people will rather like this machine.",How do you like the screen?,['virtue of the EEE PC 1000 H is its small size and light weight'],[465],[1],[0.55],[ True]

Actually, RAW files are not bad at all. They are pretty much equal or very little more noises than 5D MK3. It is just the D600 JPEG engine does not perform as good as 5D MK3. I hope Adobe updates with their RAW support for D600 soon. I have nothing bad to say about the camera now. This is by far the best camera at the price point!(Original Summary)I have been a D7000 user who just got D600. This camera is right at home for me since most controls are similar and better. I am not 100% happy with the AF speed in low light, but hey I did not pay that much, so I should not complain. I love the image quality at lower ISO. However, I envy Canon 5D Mk3's low light performance. D600 at 6400 ISO is usable, but it can get pretty noisy in shadow area. Sony sensors have better DR for sure, but no matter what DxO says, Canon 5D MK3 got better high ISO performance. This issue too I should not complain since I did not pay 5D Mk3 price. As a result, this is still the best camera for me who owns several Nikon lenses. When I first heard that D600 had 12 Mega pixel less than D800, I was hoping D600 would get less noisy than D800. It turned out that they are both similar in low light performance. I guess I was expecting too much from an affordable FF camera.Pros:1. D7000 like controls with improvements2. Amazing image quality at lower ISO3. Affordable Price4. Smaller body5. Faster Continuous Shooting than D8006. Amazing Dynamic Range7. Build-in Flash, HDR, and Timelapse mode8. Supports most Nikon lenses9. Not many people talk about this, but I love the LCD cover on Nikon cameras for protection.10. Battery life is much better than Sony SLT or mirrorless cameras11. Much better Auto ISO setting than D700012. 39 AF points. Yes, the AF area is smaller, but I am OK with it.Cons:1. No aperture control in live view and in movie mode!!! Why?!!! I guess to implement a powered aperture mechanism in a live view costs.2. I thought Sony sensors had better low light performance than Canon sensors in general like in APS-C. D600 still performs much better than D7000 in low light, but I was hoping D600 does little better than what I see from ISO6400 images.3. The AF system suppose to be the same as D7000 or better, but I often get hiccups in low light where D600 sits for a second or so.4. 1/4000 shutter speed, which is slower than D7000. Well, the D600 sensor is bigger, so I guess that is max they can do for the price.5. This is not about the camera, but I was hoping Nikon bundled a better kit lens like Canon 24-105L lens. I guess Nikon 24-120 F4 is too much to bundle as a kit lens then.All in all, I am very satisfied. I know I cannot get everything from a low cost FF camera, but if I can ask for one thing from D600 was to have little better low light performance. Maybe one stop would have made this camera perfect.",What do you think about detail?,[],[],[],[],[]

Best to use this on a desk, or do what I do, use another tray with a mousepad on it. This definitely is NOT large enough for a 17"" laptop, regardless of what the packaging says. A 15.6"" fits on here just fine, but a 17"" would definitely hang off the edges a bit and look awkward.",What is the laptop age?,[],[],[],[],[]

Very impressive VR works well.Very simple, easy to use interface.Great value at current pricing.Sleek, compact design.Screen is bright and easy to read.Free map updates (within 60 days of first use)Software updated to fix issues recently. (v4.70)FM transmitter -- though depends on your car.  Also has audio out/headphone jack.Can download lots of freebies like new voices, new vehicles, games, and so on.  (Some of the games aren't too bad.)Useful Pedestrian mode and ""last location"" feature (where did I park my car?), off road (find your way back to car after hunting/hiking in woods) and so on.Can optimize multi-stop routes for speed and efficiency (would be great for deliveries, for example).On board HELP.Cons:No printed manual.  Garmin can't include a proper printed manual?  Shame. They included plenty of color advertising brochures, cards, and such.No A/C adapter (optional extra) -- but you can use most any A/C to USB adapter.Even with latest map update, some new businesses in my area and a large development site not listed.Remarks:I just got my 855 and am quite happy with it.  I've only used it for trips around town, so far, so I need more time to give it a thorough test, but I thought I would go ahead and post some information which may be helpful to some of you. My initial impressions are good.  The user interface is probably the easiest to use of any of my GPS devices.  Screen is bright and clear.  Everything works as expected.In local trips, the tracking seems very accurate, no issues there.  The volume is adequate, but could be better.  Using the FM transmitter worked well for me and had enough volume.  Background static was only objectionable when the volume was turned up loud.  Even better, I tried using a cassette adapter which worked very well and gave great sound.  However, most of the time I just used the internal voice and speakers and they were acceptable.The Voice Recognition (VR) is the hot feature for this unit and I found it to work very well.  Quite impressive, actually.  It required no ""training"" and had a high degree of accuracy.  It is the best VR I've seen yet on any portable device.  Good enough to actually be useful.  One prime example, I can use VR to ""Zoom In"" and ""Zoom Out"" (merely by saying those phrases) of the map while driving.  I also found it worked very well to find locations on the fly.  For example, you can say ""Find Nearest Mexican Restaurant"" and it will show a list, then you just pick (by saying the number) and ""Go!"" -- very handy!  For the current price, this feature alone is worth the price of admission.So far, the navigation and routing has been fine, but I need to do more testing.  Battery power is good (3-4 hours) and the ability to pop the unit out of the cradle and take with you to use on foot (think hiking, hunting, parks, large malls, etc.) and the  ""find my car"" feature are nice pluses.  The ""Where am I?"" is also a very easy and useful way to add locations to your favorites list.I'll come back and add more after I've had more time using the unit.  Some more comments and tips below.  [If you find this review useful, please click on the ""Was this review helpful to you?"" Yes (or No) below and feel free to leave a comment or ask a question.  I'll do my best to answer those that I can. Thanks!]Comments:Found satellites and had good location within five minutes right out of the box in my family room.  Good receiver.Replaceable battery!  Can buy additional spares if needed (hiking, for example).VR works right off the bat - no ""training"" required.  Very accurate in my experience so far. (No VR system is perfect.)Free Voice Studio software allows you to record your own voice prompts!  I can see mischievous minds at work already. ;)Fast route calculations -- overall pretty snappy and accurateGood ""MyGarmin"" web site with lots of extras, FAQs and support info.Has jack for an external GPS antenna/receiver, though I doubt you'll ever need it.  Might be helpful in some trucks.On screen touch keyboard works well and is easy to use.Lets you easily create and save routes at home before your trip!  Some units I've had made this very difficult.  Very nice feature that is simple and easy to use.  Can save up to 10 Routes, each route can have multiple destinations and via points.  Shows you distance and time of travel for each route saved.  Very flexible.  The 855 will optimize routes so you visit destinations in the most efficient order.  Kudos, Garmin!Has on board HELPTips:-- Audio out/headphone jack provide an alternate way to get audio.  Can use external powered speakers, for example.  Many new cars have an audio in jack which will give better sound than via FM transmitter.  I tried using a cassette adapter (such as used to play mp3's via car radio) plugged into headphone/audio out jack and it worked very well.-- I tried various A/C USB chargers and all worked fine.  At first unit will go into ""PC connected"" mode, but if you wait 30 seconds or so, it will then switch to ""normal"" mode and you can use it as you normally would.  Will charge battery fine.  These chargers can be found for as little as $5 sometimes.-- You can press and hold battery icon to see more detailed information, such as per cent charged and even core temps. (Diagnostic display)-- I saw a tip somewhere online on how to adjust the internal mike gain to improve VR by decreasing the sensitivity to background noise.  Will update later on this,-- While at home, you can easily set/save the location in favorites as ""Home"" (Overcomes common problem of house number locations being a bit off, which affects all GPS units, by the way.)-- Amazon camera case (item No. ??? , insert link) fits this unit perfectly and has belt loop for easy carry. (Will update this info later.)-- Cancel VR button on remote works as ""back"" button on menus, too.-- Use 128 CBR mp3's (constant bit rate) for best results.-- Minimize background noises when using VR for best results.  (True with most VR gear.)-- After you do the map update, you still need to go to myGramin dashboard and check for the new software update.  Follow the instructions very carefully.  Takes awhile, but it works and will verify the update once done.-- You can fold a paper plate to make a bonnet to shield unit from sun (heat) ad make the display easier to read in bright sunlight (though I had no problems with this).  Heat may be causing some of the lockups others here have experienced.  (Punch holes and use rubber band to secure.)-  In cases where a city or street name can not be understood, use the 'spell' option in VR mode and spell the name.8/5/2010 Update:  Used this on a road trip this past weekend (200 miles) and it performed very well.  So I can verify a few more things:1)  Extremely fast recalculations if you deviate from the planned route.  So fast, you might not even notice it.  Fastest of any unit I have used.2)  Very fast satellite lock when you stop (i.e. turn off the car and GPS) and restart.  It will be ready before you are!3)  I used the VR extensively and it worked very, very well.  I had no problems even with the radio on (low) and some noise in the car.  Yes, a sharp or loud background noise might cause you to have to repeat a command now and then, but this actually happened only rarely.  Most of the time, it simply worked.  I have not seen any other GPS with VR this good and this complete (in terms of supported functions).  This was the most important feature for me and I am very pleased with it.  You can truly use this GPS hands free nearly all of the time.  And most importantly, *all* the functions you need while driving are supported. (Like zooming, accessing turn info, searching for POI's and so on.)4)  This trip was one I have taken many times, so I know the various routes pretty well.  I like to drive down one way and come back a different way.  On the way back, it found a new, faster route on a tricky section.  At first, I thought it was misdirecting me, but when I checked and then followed the new route, it was indeed a bit shorter/faster than the way I normally go and on as good or better roads.5)  The estimated arrival times were right on the money.6)  I used the built-in speakers most of the time and they were loud enough for me.7)  Very easy to use, no problems or issues.  The only other GPS I've used this good cost twice as much. Excellent at the main job of getting you where you want to go.",What is the importance of that feature to you?,[],[],[],[],[]

For I would say 80% of one's general audio needs, this is a great buy. If you want to shake the pictures off the wall, then maybe go for another package.On a basic user level, I like this unit because all the controls are located on a remote that sits on the desktop. Having to reach under the desk to adjust the bass is not necessary. Also, the various inputs/outputs are located in the same remote. The only complaint I have is that ergonomically, the remote is a bit unbalanced in the various controls - the volume knob is huge and the base is a bit hidden on the side. But that is really small potatoes overall.Regarding the actual sound, it is fine for what it is. Decent bass, the highs and overall frequency balance is fine. As with most audio setups, if you do not have an equalizer on your computer, see about getting one. While this unit is ok in its flat response, it certainly can use some tweaking to get it just right.Overall - especially in terms of price to performance - this is an A+ product.

With much that is new, even those familiar with Canon SLR's, should be prepared to spend some time frequently consulting the often confusing manual.Looking to upgrade from the 40D, I passed on the 5D Mark II, because its 3.9 frames per second shooting rate is inadequate for shooting sports.  With the new features and a shooting rate of 8 FPS, the 7D was my choice.  These are some early impressions of the 7D.Housing, Controls and Display:The 7D's heavy-duty, dust and weather resistant housing, is made of lightweight magnesium, and feels rock solid.  The 7D has a new arrangement of controls for users to get familiar with.  The mode dial is similar to the 5D Mark II (no 'Sports', 'Portrait, 'Landscape', etc).  The power switch has been relocated to behind the mode dial.  The video recording button is on the back, located on the right side of the eyepiece, similar to Canon's 'S' series cameras.  Shutter noise is quiet, similar to the 40D.  Image quality and color rendition on the LCD display is good, and looks similar to the 40D.  The display brightness can be set manually, or the camera will adjust it automatically.Pressing the 'Q' button activates the 'Quick Control Screen', a menu where a number of settings can be conveniently adjusted.  The joystick is used to toggle between functions, and settings are adjusted the normal way, using the Main and Quick Control dials.  Once you get used to it, the 'Q Menu' may become your preferred method for adjusting your settings.Autofocus:As I find that Canon's nine point focusing pattern is often inadequate, the 7D's improved autofocusing system was of special interest.  For those unfamiliar, the AF pattern is eight points in a diamond shaped layout with the ninth point in the middle of the diamond.  The new 19 point adjustable autofocus system basically adds points in the interior of the diamond area.  The actual area of coverage, does not appear to have increased.  Being center weighted is understandable, but expansion beyond the diamond area is arguably more useful than just increasing the number of focus points within the diamond area.The rule of thirds is a useful guide for composing an image, however attempting to implement this rule using the diamond shaped pattern is often difficult.  Say you want to focus on something in the top left quadrant of the frame.  One method is to lock focus on the area, reframe, and then shoot.  This works if the subject is stationary, however this method becomes more problematic for moving subjects.  If only there was a focus point nearby.  Increasing the concentration in the central area makes some sense, but I really wish they had expanded the overall area of autofocus coverage as well.That issue aside, performance of the new autofocus system appears to be a big improvement over the 40D and 50D.  The 19 individual points, are also grouped into 5 multipoint zones, which can be selected using  the Zone AF function.  This feature is very useful for many applications, like sports or group shots.  Shooting college basketball, focus lock using Zone AF was very good, much superior to single point focus.  The high speed continuous shooting mode (8 FPS) is smooth like butter.  The shutter button quite sensitive, but keeping the camera steady in burst mode takes practice.Remote Triggering and Wireless Flash:A very convenient feature that was a long time coming to Canon's prosumer line, is the ability to remotely trigger the 7D using Canon's RC-1 remote, or other inexpensive remotes.  The 7D can also be triggered by Pocket Wizards, via the N3 terminal.  The integral flash is essential, and the 7D also has the capability to wirelessly trigger compatible Canon speedlights, eliminating the need for the ST-E2 transmitter, and makes creative flash photography more convenient.Live View, Video, and Memory:Photography via live view mode, is similar to a point and shoot, although the 7D is a little heavy to be holding in front of your face.  As claimed by Canon, the image taken seems to be 100% of what appears in the LCD display.  I use live view for rough framing when the camera is on a tripod.  For HD video a fast card is a must, Canon recommends using a CF card with a transfer rate of 8MB/second.  Shooting video is simple, though the results can be kind of spotty.  Check YouTube for video reviews of the 7D, and examples of videos shot with the 7D.  Picture quality can be quite good, although skin tones may not be accurate, and AF is not continuous.  You will need ample memory to shoot video, as a 4GB card holds about 12 minutes of content.  For images at highest image quality (RAW + JPEG), the camera reads that a 32 GB card will hold about 960 images, an 8 GB card about 240, and a 4 GB card about 125.ISO:As the 40D tops off at ISO 1600, the 7D's ability to shoot up to ISO 6400 is mind-blowing.  The noise in test shots at ISO 4000 and above, were not bad.  I rarely exceed ISO 800, but it is something I will now look into further.LP-E6 Battery:Canon's LP-E6 batteries have a serial number, and the 7D will keep track of the battery's power level, and number of shots taken.  Canon continues to take measures to discourage the use of third party products.  Non-Canon versions of the LP-E6 battery will work in the 7D, but are not recognized, and read as `empty' on the battery meter, with no data available.  Having used non-Canon BP-511 batteries for years in various Canon SLR's, without any problems, I do not believe that they are inferior or dangerous.  You can pay $60 for the Canon LP-E6 if you wish, but you can get generic LP-E6 batteries for as low as $10.In these hard economic times, value and quality are even more important.  The 7D does cost more than the 40D and 50D when they debuted, but it is worth it.  The 7D is better built, has many more standard features, and produces better images.  It appears that Canon is very serious about competing with Nikon, which should benefit users of both brands.  It will take some time for most users to begin tap into the potential this camera offers.  Have fun taking some great images.",How is the learn curve?,[],[],[],[],[]

To my shock, it was amazingly fast compared to last Friday 10/25/2013.  Why?  I think that the two software updates that the tablet received needed a factory reset to actually take advantage of the updates.After the factory reset, the tablet is much more stable and is quicker than the 2012/2013 model.  Moving forward, I will retract my first review and expand it.  I want to thank those that participated in the discussion; their feedback and suggestions helped me to give this tablet another try.This review will be broken up to various sections.  They include: applicability of technical specs, applicability of software features, Samsung perks, UI, physical attributes, and the upgrading process.Applicability of Technical Specs:2560X1600 Screen:This screen is very bright, brilliant, and sharp.  It's actually one of the best screens I have ever seen on a tablet.  It actually blows the N8000s screen away.  Its very easy on the eyes while browsing the internet, reading a book or watching a movie.4 core 1.9 GHz Processing Power with 3gb of ram:The tablet can handle close to any application that is thrown at it.  After the updates and factory reset, S Note imported the entire 56 page pdf while the N8013 was still importing slide 17 of 56.  While playing graphically intense games, the tablet is smooth as butter.  When switching between apps and screens, the tablet does so rapidly with no lag.8220 mAh Battery:The original N8013 had around a 7000 mAh Battery and use to last all day.  However the increased processing speed and screen capabilities may draw excess power from the 2014 note's 8220 mAh battery.  So far, the Note 2014 has decent battery life.  The screen has been on for 7 hours and 43 minutes.  While the screen was on, I was taking notes with Lecture Notes for about 4-5 hours.  I spent about 30 minutes using Handy Scanner, an app that takes photos of documents and imports them into pdf files.  Also, I sent a lot of emails and uploaded a lot of files to to my Google Drive.  the brightness level of the screen was about 20% which is really bright in a lit room.  The battery is at 14%.  I got up at 6:00 am and started using it.  It is now 9:26pmRear 8 MP Camera:The camera is an upgrade over the 5MP camera on the N8013, however because the screen has a really good resolution, it seems to make the picture seem worse than it is.  I have this effect on my desktop computer with two monitors, bad pictures look better on the screen with the poorer resolution.  Anyhow, objectively, the camera is just like the ones from last year's cell phones.  The added flash is nice to have because a lot of tablets seem to leave this essential feature out.Capacity:Either you have the 16 GB or the 32 GB version; I'm pretty sure you know the benefits of both.  However its important to note that the 32 GB version leaves around 25 GB of actual space to use.  With the N8013, I never filled up the flash drive despite having close to 1000 songs, 200+ photos, and a years worth of lecture notes and document files.  However, usage patterns do vary; if you are the type of person that likes large games, then you could certainly get the 32 GB model of the device and then store extra content on a 64GB micro SD card.Applicability of Software Features:S Note:The main critical point of the 1st edition of this review revolved around S Note and the lag; S Note and the slow performance are the main reasons that I bought the tablet; the initial experiences ruined this tablet for me.  However, THE FACTORY RESET CLEARED UP ALL OF THE LAG/INSTABILITY IN S NOTE AND SYSTEM WIDE.S Note has a new interface that really contrasts with previous versions of S Note.  Shape and Formula Match have been separated from the main tool bar and included under the heading transform, the icon that resembles the cloud.On first thought, this seems innovative, however compared to the old version of Shape Match, this process can be counter productive.  For instance, on the old version, one could just select the shape match tool and then draw the shape.  If unhappy with the shape, the user could simply press the undo arrow and try again.  However, on the new version, you must write the text first and then transform it into a shape or text via the selection tool.  If you make a mistake, you must press undo and fix the thing that you were trying to transform.  This feature is annoying and counter productive in my opinion.  I frequently take Cornell notes where you draw a line down the middle of the paper, closer to the left side of the sheet.  With the new set up, I have two extra steps, I have to draw a line and then draw a free form or rectangular box around the imperfect line that I drew just to turn it into a straight line...As far as having Wolfram Alpha solve equations directly through S Note, some users have reported that its imbedded in the keyboard some where.Concerning old .snb files, the tablet does not support them on the fly, but it CAN convert them to the new format.  After the factory reset, the tablet is quicker and more stable at converting the .snb files; there have been no crashes during conversion.First glance, the previews to notebooks are gone on the new version of S Note.  The previews to the notes have been replaced with realistic looking book covers.  If you once depended on looking at the note in order to easily find it, think again; to get a preview, you must drag the icon down towards the bottom of the screen.There are more advanced templates available on the device; they actually look pretty nice.  Instead of calling home made templates ""templates,"" the device has a feature to import a photo to be used as a background for notes; this is better than nothing.As far as sync accounts within S Note, Google Drive seems to be missing as an option.  If there is a way to add it, please someone respond so that I can edit this.  In the mean time, I will look for a solution.  Currently on the 2014 model, Sync options include the Samsung Account and Evernote.Writing with the new S pen seems smoother and better, however that's due to the increased friction.  The increased friction seems to slow down writing a little, but an after market pen or more use may rectify this problem.[Edit: S Note Conversion/Import/Export File Sizes and Time to CompleteIF the relationship between file size and import/export/conversion time is linear, these results should be able to be generalized to your hypothetical 50,000KB files.My test file was a 16,314 KB pdf. To import the file, it took 197 seconds; this substantially quicker than the N8013. For your hypothetical file of 50,000 KB, the import would take around 10 minutes or 603.78 seconds IF the relationship is linear.This same 16,314KB pdf translated into a 59.74MB .spd S Note file once it was imported without any annotations. It took 40 seconds to export this file to a pdf document. For your hypothetical file of 50,000 KB, the pdf export should be around 122 seconds or 2 minutes.As far as converting .snb files to the new .spd format, the relationship seems to be 2 and a half minutes/80,000KB .snb file.]Multiview:Multiview is still here on the 2014 note.  Its useful but it doesn't use the same intuitive methods as the N8013 does.  Simply tapping on the icon for Multiview does not launch it along side another window, you must drag it over.I as well as other users initially reported that there is no pin window feature.  Upon further exploration, this is not true.  It is accessible from the Air View window; you must draw a space for the application and then select from the limited supply of apps including; calculator, alarm, You Tube, contacts, ChatOn, Hangouts, and internet.  In my opinion, this is counter productive in comparison to the old simple pin window button.Browser:The default browser has trouble with saving .ppt and .doc formats.  I went to blackboard and tried to download a .ppt for viewing and Polaris 5 wouldn't open it.  Using the Blackboard app rectified this occurrence.  I have not tested with Chrome yet.Polaris Office:Polaris Offcice is a great alternative to Microsoft Office for editing or creating documents on the fly.  I mainly use Polaris for converting powerpoints to pdf so that they can be imported to S note.  Polaris 5 can also be used for direct pdf and powerpoint annotations; this method does not seem to support palm rejection, but it's still very useful for those that follow slides, type notes on slides and do light annotations to the slides.Watch On:This is a great TV guide like application.  The bonus is that it uses the built in IR blaster.  This is a cool feature if you are missing the remote or want to impress friends.My Magazine:This is a great media hub for news.  If you follow world news, you can have a great deal of information in this one app.Sketchbook For Galaxy/ Photoshop Touch:Sketchbook For Galaxy is a great alternative to the missing Photoshop touch.  The sketchbook app provides an experience even closer to the real Photoshop desktop app.Samsung Perks:[Retrieved 10/27/2013 12:50 Central Time]""Get a $50 credit for music, movies and TV shows through Samsung Hub and a $25 credit for games and apps through the Google Play(tm) Store. New Hulu Plus users get a 3-month trial and new Boingo users get mobile Wi-Fi access for 12 months. Also, new Audible users get 3 free audiobooks and new Zinio members get a 2-month subscription to 3 digital magazines. New BusinessWeek+ Tablet App users can also enjoy a 1-year free subscription, and new NYTimes.com + Tablet App users get a 12-week free subscription. All that, plus up to 50GB of Dropbox space--yours for 2 years from the time you set up the app.""These perks speak for themselves :]User Interface:The tablet's user interface seems counterproductive in comparison to the more simple nature of the first edition.  There are some things that touchwiz does better and some things that it does worse.  All I can say is that the settings section is very confusing.  For example, Samsung even hid the developer options; they can only be unhidden by tapping the build # a number of times...Coming from the N8013's simplistic nature can be kind of harsh, but it is certainly doable.  Read the user guide or google the answers to your confusion.Physical Attributes:The tablet aesthetically is really nice on the eyes.  I always thought that the original N8013 was a little homely.  I'm not sure why the ""pleather"" (plastic leather) look has people complaining.  I think it looks nice.I do not like the capacitive buttons nor the home button on the bezel.  It becomes cumbersome to hold  the tablet in portrait mode; sometimes your hand may hit one of the capacitive buttons or it may be awkward to intentionally use them while the device is in portrait mode.  I have always found the softkeys that rotate with the screen better.  In addition, I don't like the feel of the home button, it seems like it may degrade over time; in my opinion, the less physical buttons, the better.  The iPhone, iPad, and iPod  home buttons of earlier generations seem more sturdy than button on the 2014 note; this may not be true, it's just a subjective thought.The S Pen tip certainly feels better on the screen compared to last year's model.  In addition, the S Pen seems even more comfortable to write with despite its skinny nature.  Another bonus is that it doesn't require a special rotation to get the S Pen into the stylus holder slot.Concerning weight and thinness, the tablet does look cooler than the previous edition, but if you are highly protective of the device and put it in a case, all of that really doesn't matter.The shift from Samsung's special usb cable is really nice.  Now, the tablet can interact with the USB cables that our smart phones have been using for years!Upgrade Experience:There are a lot of things that the tablet does that are similar to the N8000s, however there are a lot of things that are different.  There will be a learning curve and importing your old notes to the new note is not as straightforward as it could be.  However, the improved processing speed and screen are very compelling reasons to get this tablet.As of now, I officially recommend this tablet to new users or people that upgrade from a previous generation note.Again, I must reiterate  that after the factory reset, the tablet is much more stable and is quicker than the 2012/2013 model.  Moving forward, I want to thank those that participated in the discussion because their feedback and suggestions helped me to give this tablet another try.BEFORE BASHING THE TABLET AND INITIATING A RETURN PROCESS, TRY A FACTORY RESET AFTER THE UPDATES; I learned my lesson lol",How was my camera's resolution?,[],[],[],[],[]

I've tried Cyber Acoustic products against Logitech and Altec Lansing, and these speakers are by far the best in their category.Firstly, the satellite tower design includes two speakers per tower, which helps distribute sound over a greater area than with single speaker designs. This greatly improves the listening experience, as the ""sweet spot"" area has widened so listeners perceive full-sounding stereo from a variety of locations in a small room. Additionally this avoids the pitfalls of ""small"" computer speakers which sound small, like music playing from a tin box. (the CA speakers 1 level below these with a single speaker design by comparison sound MUCH worse).Secondly, the bass and speakers are very powerful for their size, and have little to no distortion even at full-volume.The sub-woofer volume is adjustable independently of the other speakers. This lets you boost bass for music genres with a lot of low-frequency sounds, such as electronic/dance or hip-hop/rap, and likewise decrease bass for genres like classical and acoustic where the bass could overwhelm the instruments or vocals.The cord is conveniently long ans contains a circular volume control with a headphone jack and aux input.NOTE: I have two of these speaker systems because a roommate dropped a satellite speaker and broke the plastic foot. They are plenty sturdy if you respect them and should last a long time if handle them carefully. I guess that also shows how good these speakers are, that they broke and I bought them again.I'm a recording enthusiast, and these speakers satisfy my needs. They are not studio monitors but it's definitely possible to create good mixes on them. They take up considerably less space than professional studio monitors and are hundreds of dollars cheaper, but the sound quality is not significantly worse than monitors I've tried.

I thought long and hard before I gave it only three stars. But, despite it being better than any other compact, I still have lots of criticism.The good:The image quality is very strong. Not as good as the DP1/2, but that camera is a disaster in nearly all other regards. With F/2 and and 400 you'll likely get the indoor shot you need. And when that fails, 800 is tolerable. The LX3 is a zippy performer too. While a little slow on the startup, the auto-focus is decently quick (could be better) and the shot to shot performance is quite good. The full-auto mode is good too. Hand the camera over to a novice and he/she will get a good shot. Love the aspect ratio.The meh:The zoom range is a little limited. But I'm not too bothered by it. Other than macro, I can't imagine the manual focus ever being usable. I'd gladly give up some screen real estate for a viewfinder (even an evf). An integrated lens cap would have been a nice touch, as would a wrist strap. It'd be nice if the RAW format were more open. At the time of this review Aperture doesn't support it at all and Lightroom only kinda supports it.The bad:My main complaint is the interface. It's not awful. In fact it's probably better than most compacts. But this camera had so much manual potential, only to be let down my too many darned buttons. The user programable setting are a good example. It has four presets. But only two of them are really useful. The other two require you to turn the dial, hit the select button, navigate down and then confirm; you just missed your shot. I wonder why it would be so difficult to have two or three more dials on the camera to control shutter, aperture and ISO? Instead, we get the worlds tiniest joystick. Again, by the time you've actually changed a setting you probably missed the shot. Also, why is a manual focus that goes around the lens so hard to implement? It's such a wonderful convention that is almost never seen on a compact.The wrap up:I do really like this camera. It's a good RAW shooter with good quality; all in a compact package. But, I hope that Panasonic really concentrates on the fundamentals for the LX4. A viewfinder and a couple of dials or knobs would have made this a four star camera for sure. If they managed to squeeze a larger sensor in too, it would be the best camera of all time.The unrelated:Shame on Amazon for allowing price gouging from their partners. Currently (April/May 2009) the LX3K is quite scarce. I ended up paying a reasonable $50 over MSRP. But during the shortage the camera has been on sale for as much as $750 ($250 over MSRP!). Capitalism, the free market and supply/demand are all good things. But I'm a little offended that Amazon would allow their customers to be bludgeoned by such heavy pricing.

For this reason, these are way better than the Bose IE2's, which ARE NOT NOISE CANCELLING.

Got rid of my 85.00 mo. satellite bill and subscribed to netflix and playon for 15.00 a month, both of which have a ton of hidden channels so I get all the shows except one I always watched, and I can watch it online.  My hubby got an LG hdtv with apps and we were impressed.  After I read about roku, I purchased a LG hdtv without apps and hooked a roku to it and its superior to the one with apps now.  Netflix especially works better with roku.  After 3 mos. my hubby decided he wanted a roku since I was getting way more programming. Upon checking out roku I found the roku 2 available and we ordered the xs model with the Angry Birds on it.  It is a bit smaller than the original roku, has a place for a micro-mini sd card expanding the memory so you can add more roku channels then usual.  I really liked that!  The setup was great, it updated immediately and wirelessly with no problem 2 rooms away from my router.  I bought an ethernet cable in case the update wirelessly hit a snag, as it did on the LG, but didn't need it.  PLug in the electric cord, hook the hdmi cable to the tv and roku, turn it on and let it update and follow on screen instructions.  Simple!  I was surprised that  I could add all the same channels on his roku as on mine without having to activate the channels.  I knew netflix allowed 6 tvs in the same home on one account, but didnt know roku would let you add another roku without all the hassel of activations.  The only channel I had to activate separately was epix.  It is a 14 day free trial deal, so each account must be on a separate email account and each device activated separately.  I did activate netflix on the roku because the movie images are much larger then on his hdtv and his eyesight isnt the best.  It makes it a lot easier for him to select a movie.  This roku lets you use the ethernet cable or wireless.  It has the Angry Birds which loads after update.  My only complaint is that I cannot get round one of the Birds to work.  It loads and starts but I can't get any action.  Im not familiar with this game so will have to do some research on this.  The remote is better on the roku 2.  Its rounded instead of square, the arrow keys are more defined, it has a separate ok button.  It has 2 extra buttons, A and B to use when playing the game.  The instruction booklet is very poor concerning the birds.  No instruction on how to play the game or what those two buttons do.  The remote is similar to a wii, you wave it and the cursor moves to where you want it.  I may not have gotten a good install of the game so I will remove it and reinstall and see if that works.  This is a much improved device for 99.00.  Locally, the old rokus are being sold for the same prices, no discount.  May as well buy the new improved for 99.00 as an older model without the improvements for the same price.  This is an excellent gift, especially for anyone trying to save money in the bad times.

It took a while to set up, but it's so feature packed that I have a tough time deciding between this and my old router (a more expensive Netgear WNDR3700).What's good:- It has dual band 2.4 and 5.0 ghz data, which lets you run your older devices on 2.4, then reserve 5.0 for video streaming and data intensive uses.  The speed is good.  Downloads go great, and I can watch HD video over the internet without a hiccup.- It has two usb ports that you can use to hook a usb printer, hard drive, or even data stick to your local area network or even to set up an internet enabled ftp server.- The administration page is pretty straightforward, and comes with a lot of features, like parental controls or ""QoS,"" a feature that lets you allocate more bandwidth to your more important applications.- If you're into third party firmware, it looks like it's compatible with openwrt and dd-wrt, although I haven't tried it, so use with caution.- After upgrading to the newest firmware, this is the most customizeable router I've seen.-- With the new firmware, it does have a guest mode, which allows my house guests to get on the net without accessing my LAN or getting a password.  Better yet, this router allows me to limit the amount of bandwidth available to guests!  I'm not that mean, but I appreciate the option.  ;-)-- The firmware allows me to adjust the wireless width on the 2.4 gHz channel - the first time I've ever seen that, and I'm looking forward to see if it increases range and throughput.What could be better:- Even after maximizing wireless width, this still doesn't have as much range as I hoped.  It's good in my house, but the 2.4 range is still weak in my yard, compared to my previous router.- One very minor complaint is that the router is not very attractive - big antennae and an angry blueberry salad of blinking lights make this look like something that should be hidden in a closet someplace.Set-up tips:- I didn't have much luck with the mini-cd, but opening a browser window to the administration page (192.168.0.1) got me in with no trouble, and the ""quick setup"" did most of what I needed.- TP-Link recommends a complete powerdown after setting up.  Power down your cable modem, router, and computer, wait two minutes, then power them on in the same order, waiting for each one to boot fully before starting the next one.  After I did that, it worked without a hitch.- I'm running firmware version 3.13.31, released March 9, 2013.It took me a good half hour to set up the way I wanted, but now I like it quite a bit.

Job changed so the monitor became part of a multi display home office along with a Dell monitor from years ago.The difference in picture quality is enough that I got another Asus to replace the dell. The Asus monitor is much brighter, higher contrast, and deeper colors. Text is easier to read. This is in all ambient light conditions I've had to deal with. These are the VS247H-P 23.6 inch displays.About the stand. It is not up to the job. If your desk is rock solid it will hold the monitor, but if you have desks that shudder every time someone passes by, or when you nudge it inadvertently, the monitor will wobble annoyingly. Dell does have solid stands on the monitors they sell. So when I ordered the second I didn't bother attaching the stand.

About four years later I have sold all my original purchases.  The Canon EF 28-135mm was my most used lens, and I still had it until March 2006 when I replaced it with the Canon EF 24-105mm IS f/4L.Being an L lens, the dust and moisture resistant construction of the Canon EF 24-105mm IS f/4L is sturdy.  The lens consists of eighteen elements in thirteen groups including one Super-UD glass element and three aspherical lenses to minimize chromatic aberration and distortion.  With a standard twist zoom focus, this lens permits for auto or manual focusing depending on how the switch is set.Some of the earlier lenses had an issue that caused lens flare.  This issue was resolved quickly with a recall.  If the control number located on the back cover of the lens begins with a UT and the following number is less than 1,000, then the lens is affected and should be sent in for repair.The Canon EF 24-105mm IS f/4L lens is compact measuring 5 inches long and lightweight weighing in at about 1.5 lbs/670g, and accepts 77mm filters.  Be sure to get agood quality UV haze filterto protect the front lens element. Not only do I see this as a good practice, Canon recommends doing so on their site as well.  The f/stop ranges from 4 - 22. The closest focusing distance is 18 in/45 cm. In addition, the lens has a USM drive mechanism for optimum AF performance, and the pulse control diaphragm (EMD) ensures precise aperture control.The IS system is composed of a pair of gyro sensors to detect vertical and horizontal motion and a microprocessor that compensates for it by shifting special lens elements in parallel with the perceived movement. It is recommended that the IS be off when shooting on a tripod. I have used the IS on myBogen 3231 monopod with legssuccessfully. A monopod is not as stable as a tripod though, with or without the legs. Using the IS, you can obtain sharp pictures three stops below where you normally would. This is a huge advantage in dim light or places where flash is prohibited. Just keep in mind, the IS attempts to eliminate camera movement, not the movement of the subject being photographed.A distance scale ring sits below the focus ring. Turn the distance scale ring all the way to the left and you are set for low magnification close-up photography. Turn it to the right and you are able to set for infinity compensating for changes in temperature as necessary. The distance scale includes figures in red as an infrared index to use when shooting black and white infrared film. Shooting infrared is not available on all cameras. If this feature is a must, make sure this lens is compatible for infrared photography on your camera body.The Canon EF 24-105mm IS f/4L includes a 1 Year US Warranty, the front & rear lens caps, theLP1219 soft pouch, and theEW-83H lens hood.  The hood will decrease chances of lens flare and increase metering accuracy. If you use filters, Canon recommends against stacking.The Canon EF 28-135mm lens is similar in build a little shorter and weighs a couple ounces less.  Of course the Canon EF 28-135mm has a wider focal range.  Both lenses have single mode IS capabilities, and are good walkabout lenses.  Having used the Canon EF 24-105mm IS f/4L the difference in weight and length is hardly noticeable.  The shorter focal distance is not missed, and I have a constant f/4 through out the focal scale unlike the Canon EF 28-135mm with a 5.6-36 on the long focal range.  The images using the Canon EF 24-105mm IS f/4L is sharper and clearer than those using the Canon EF 28-135mm.If the Canon EF 24-105mm f/4.0L IS lens' price is not a problem, this is the lens to get. Otherwise purchase and enjoy the28-135mm IS lens.  The great thing about Canon lenses is they tend to hold their value.  If you want to upgrade from the 28-135mm, sell it on a popular auction site like I did.PROS:A compact L standard IS zoom that is an excellent walkabout lens.Versatile multipurpose lensCONS:A price typically found on L lensesMay become your most used lens",How to claim cash?,[],[],[],[],[]

I had purchased the Apple bluetooth keyboard for my original iPad but stopped using it after some time due to having to carry it around separately. I recently purchased the 4th generation iPad and saw this keyboard thanks to a banner ad from Amazon. I decided to give it a try.First, the keyboard itself has a great feel to it. Very easy to type and great feedback. The best feature of the keyboard has to be that it doubles as a smart case so no more carrying around a &#34;separate&#34; keyboard. It protects your iPad and attaches very nicely to it. Simply open this keyboard cover on the iPad and it slides nicely into the middle of the keyboard. It displays the iPad at a great angle for reading and fits pretty securely into the slot. The slot also seems to have a magnetic connection to it to hold the iPad more securely as well.Connecting the keyboard via bluetooth is of course very simple. It also has an on/off switch which is nice for battery preservation. It's also a better switch than what Apple's had where I couldn't easily tell if the keyboard was on/off.The keyboard charges with a standard (yes standard) USB mini connection. The cable that comes with the keyboard only hooks up to a USB port on say a computer and not a wall adapter but that was ok for me. The cable is also VERY short. But that was ok for me because I have simply been using a different USB mini power cable that plugs into the wall that I use to charge my bluetooth headset for my phone. One less charger to carry around. Also, so far the keyboard seems to hold a charge for a LONG time. I haven't run out of battery yet nor even seen the low battery indicator the keyboard claims to have. I've gone 7 days without charging and it's been fine. Now during that time I wasn't using it all day but still...I HIGHLY recommend this keyboard. The feel of the keyboard is awesome, the fact that it connects so well to iPad as a Smartcase makes it like you aren't even carrying a keyboard, and it adds protection to your iPad screen.",How is it feel ?,[],[],[],[],[]

I'll list a few pros and cons and then talk about what I think of the product overall.Pros-Easy to use, feels amazing. It uses a usb stick to do everything, although you do need to have your own charger cable as it doesn't come with one (USB to mini usb). The headset is very comfortable and has plushy padding on the ear cups and head band. I have no problem wearing these for lengthy gaming sessions (3 hours or more) or watching a couple movies in a row.-Packs a lot of sound, for it being virtual 7.1 it sounds great but not amazing. If you're used to high end headsets/headphones this might not be the thing for you, but if you're looking to save some money and still have a decent headset then you definitely want to pick this up. The stereo sounds good, but the virtual surround sound is the way to go.-Looks fantastic, this is one of the better looking headsets I've owned. It might not be for everyone, but I really like the design of this.-Absolutely wireless, this is a huge plus for me as I hate having to deal with wires.-I've talked with friends over games and over skype and they all say that the mic sounds good, but for skype I normally use my Blue Snowball USB mic anyway.Cons-Controls for sound/volume are weird. There are two control slides, one for game/movie volume and one for voice chat (in game). When I'm playing with friends and we're in an intense game, sometimes I'll need to adjust the headset so I can hear them better rather than the game volume. I've noticed that it's just easier to take off the headset entirely and change it that way that moving my hand behing my head in a somewhat awkward position. It's not a deal breaker by any means buts till annoying.-While I complimented the sound in the pros, I need to mention it in the cons as well. It's not going to blow you away, the virtual surround is good but it's still virtual. I've noticed the highs are great, the mids are awesome, but the lows are just alright.Those are the main points I wanted to make, but I also want to note that before this headset I owned a pair of Tritton AX Pros. The Tritton's were beast, had great sound and a great sounding mic. They weren't without fault though as they were really heavy on my head. Felt like a full pound or so, while this Sony headset is really light and feels great on the ears. The Tritton's also required a whole slew of wires to be attached and taken off then reattached: it was a mess. The number one reason for me getting this Sony headset is because it's wireless, the second was the amazing price. The sound is about 3.75 stars, while the price bumps it to about 4.5. I would like to give it a 4.5 star rating but Amazon doesn't allow .5 increments, and it's definitely not a 5 star headset so 4 stars will have to do.I hope this rather long review helps you in your buying process.Z",How is the quality?,[],[],[],[],[]

I was looking for a second computer that could do fairly basic Windows stuff and multimedia while also being very compact and having a long battery life.I had previously purchased an Atom-based Asus netbook that was atrociously slow and only lasted a few hours, plus the fan was annoyingly loud.Here are my findings:GOOD:- The T100 is as fast as you need a second computer to be.  MS Office runs smoothly, all videos play well and it's never slowed down terribly so far.  I haven't run any processor-intensive stuff yet like Photoshop or Crisis, but that's not why I purchased it.- The screen is rather nice.  It's an IPS WXGA screen, which pales in comparison to some 1080p phones, but for a 10.2"" netbook, it works well.  Text is readable and videos look great.  The brightness isn't spectacular and the reflectivity is high, but it's very crisp and the viewing angles are excellent.- There are no fans.  It runs cool.  It runs silent.- The speakers are better than my 17"" laptop.  Not great in the bass department, but they're loud.  I just wish they were facing forward instead of backward.- It's super light and compact.  I'm able to read holding just the screen and the whole package, including the keyboard, fits nicely into the Kensington tablet sling I just purchased.- The construction is solid.  Yes, the lid and screen are smudge-prone, but it's all solid state and thoughtfully arranged...for a $400 piece of hardware.BAD:- The WiFi is a bit wonky.  When I wake my computer, sometimes the WiFi won't work but when I just turn the laptop's WiFi antenna off and on, everything goes back to normal.- The charger is as slow as people are reporting.  Sometimes it charges fairly slowly, other times, not at all.  Still working that out.- The trackpad is annoying and unpredictable.  Once I turned off the tap-to-click feature, it was much more manageable except the trackpad clicks are conspicuously loud.  Remedied by a bluetooth mouse.OTHER THOUGHTS:- I appreciate the microSD slot.  I put in a 64GB chip and it works great.- Some have complained about the single-antenna WiFi, but it hasn't bothered me at all.  Streaming music and video is not a problem.- The tablet doesn't fit in immediately so you kind of have to wiggle it in so it will fit flush with the keyboard.- Windows 8.1 presents a learning curve.  It's also not the greatest OS for a tablet computer.  But once you get used to the quirks, it's not a dealbreaker.- The keyboard is small but totally usable.  With its weird layout and lack of backlighting, it's not great in the dark, but otherwise, it's fine.IN SUM:For me, this computer does everything I expect it to do.  It's tiny, relatively fast and the battery life is tops.  That said, there are many idiosyncrasies that you must contend with.  WiFi, keyboard and charging require some fiddling, but maybe those things will be ironed out in future updates.All in all, it's a great piece of hardware.  If you're looking for something that has the portability of a tablet but the functionality of a laptop for $400, it's an amazing deal that can't be beat.  For the price, there are better laptops and there are better tablets, but as a low-priced combo, it's a grand slam.",What is the quality of the screen?,['The screen is rather nice' 'The screen is rather nice'],[777 777],[2 2],[1. 1.],[ True  True]

It was nice to see how bright it was even during the daytime, windows all on one side of the room but no strong light as it is the start of winter and a basement.  Summer time it would be good to have curtains for light control like any projector.  When I get curtains up I am sure that will take care of any issues during daytime, even in summer. Of course as with any projector the more control over light in the room the better the picture. I did a lot of research before purchasing this unit. As a projector unless one has a totally dark room meaning zero light and dark walls then ANSI lumens are important, this one with its 2000 ANSI LUMENS is great and use this to compare with other projectors, if less I would be weary.I wanted to have a NATIVE 1080P RESOLUTION which I do not regret and would not get a projector with lower resolution. One may notice that a projectors specs say they can do 1080 but this is misleading as this is not NATIVE resolution, meaning they try to upconvert to a 1080i (i=interpolated) and it is not the same thing, not even close. I want to see blu rays in their full resolution which this does. One may also purchase an A/V receiver to upconvert the source material for best picture quality, my Blu Ray player also does this upconversion, but it is still not a true 1080P. While not as good as the 1080P one will see when playing a Blu Ray disc for example, the picture from HD cable channel which is 720P is still AMAZING just as good as the picture on my 42 inch LCD HDTV and better than my older 55 inch rear projection HDTV. High Def video from a home video source such as full 1080P from an AVCHD format camcorder for example is stunning and home movies look as good or better than store bought if done properly. The input source is of course going to dictate how good the picture is, so it will look as good as the source input, this is not always the case with all projectors, they have to have the capacity to project the image at full input resolution such as this one. Most projectors that have this resolution cost more and a flat panel in the screen sizes this is capable of are going to be many thousands of dollars more.I do not use the Eco setting but the bulbs last 3-4000 hours and are only around 120.00 and you only need one which is a very good deal.  One of the great and unique features of this projector are the LENS SHIFT adjustment wheels, this projector does not have to be dead center on with the screen as those knobs can shift the picture both vertically and horizontally, at least several inches or more depending on how far the projector is away from the screen, in some situations this could mean the difference between having a projector and screen work in a room or not. The lens shift moves the picture left to right or up and down keeping it in focus.  So your screen can be way off from being centered with the projector and still fit dead on.  The projector itself has plenty of features and adjustments but it did not take long to find a good setting close to out of the box. While this has 2 HDMI inputs I only use one with all of my components running through my A/V receiver, a Pioneer Elite VSX30 for 275 with 7.1 surround which I am very happy with.I got the Peerless mount that I think was a good choice, it fits this projector and is good quality with two nice pitch adjustment knobs. It is white and matches the color of the projector well. Since it is ceiling mounted it is up and out of the way of my dog and one has to be right up close to the screen before one would block the picture at all, standing in between the projector and screen with this set up does not shadow the screen.If one is going to ceiling mount this you may wish to purchase a longer power cord.  I bought a 15 foot power cord for this for about 8 bucks so it is long enough to plug in to my power conditioner, extension cords are a bad idea. This worked great for my ceiling installationCables To Go 09482 18 AWG Universal Power Cord, IEC320C13 to NEMA 5-15P (15 Feet)One can run cords through walls or you can do as I did and use conduit such as the product here which hides the cord and sticks on and requires no nails.Wiremold C210 White Cordmate II Kitso it looks like a nice clean installation.I also being on a budget bought the Favi 100 inch 16:9 widescreenFAVI HD-100 16:9/100-Inch Electric Projector Screenwhich works great and provides an awesome picture with this projector.  My set up surprises everyone that it did not cost much more. It comes in various sizes but 100 inches was the biggest that would fit.  There is information here on the pages of the FAVI screens for sale which will show you the dimensions of each screen size to help determine the size screen that will fit in your room.  In my case both the horizontal fit as well as how far the screen came down was important information.While all my components are capable of 3D I have not really liked 3D that much in the theater and decided I would not want to play much 3D content at home so I concentrated on brightness and the 1080P resolution and the adjustment features of this projector and zero regrets.  If I were to change my mind in the future when the technology has progressed I can revisit that, but for now this is all I could ever want.I like this better than the movie theater.  As the screen is smaller it is easier to get a high resolution picture.  The surround sound speakers which are the Energy Take Classic 5.1 set with the Energy CF-30 floor standing speakers (I got a great deal for 150 each new) make for wonderful sound.  There is plenty of great home theater equipment out there but this was the best for my budget at the time.  I would highly recommend a good audio set up to go along with the amazing picture quality you will have with this projector.If you purchase this and want some set up help there is a web site projector central (...) where you can enter your projector model and screen size and it's contrast ratio and seating location and other information and it has a wizard that will tell you the optimum distance to mount the projector from the screen and ideal seating distances and details such as that.  Very helpful in a successful installation. I used their calculations with perfect results.I also got a Harmony 1100 remote so that I don't need 6-7 remotes,Logitech Harmony 1100 Universal Remote with Color Touch ScreenI got that new for 200.00 (heck of a deal) and extra batteries on Amazon for 8.75 eachLogitech Battery for Harmony Remote Control 1000 1100 1100i 3.7V 1250mAh.  That works like a charm with it's touch screen.  I even got a IR dimmer switch that runs off its own remote or the Harmony remote. I also got the RF accessory so I can use either RF (which is not line of sight) or RF to IR for all the components, helpful if your components are behind your seating location.I highly recommend this projector.  I would not settle for one with lower resolution or lower lumen output, you would never obtain as high resolution as a full 1080P projector and you would not get the brightness necessary for daytime viewing if you do not have a room that is completely dark. On the other hand for $1050.00 you will be quite happy with the picture you get from this especially if the source is at least HD (720P) or using its full capability of 1080P quality like a Blu Ray. t  Not that it is bad with a regular definition channel or regular DVD, but you get your most amazing picture with the best input source just as is the case with any projector or TV. I can't emphasize enough how much the 1080P quality is worth.  This projector is simply the best deal for the money I could find. Consider this, if you want a large picture you can get a very large screen such as the Favi or many others that are at least 120 inches, this projector could potentially display a giant 300 inch picture if you have the space to do so.  But even at 100 inches like I have what else can you get for that money in this size with this resolution aside from a good projector? Very little and it is going to cost a lot more. And if you have an electric screen that moves out of the way you take up very little space when not in use and the projector itself takes up very little space. Also unlike a flat panel TV you have a set picture size.  With a projector like this you can just change your screen size while using the same projector and go smaller or larger with the screen size if you change the location which either constricts the size of the screen you are able to use or enlarges the space to allow for a larger screen.  This is a flexibility you will only find in a projector.  And with the lens shift of this particular projector you have even more flexibility for placement of the projector.Also consider that this weighs about 16 pounds out of the box.  An LCD flat panel HDTV would likely weight 100 plus for a large one.  So this give you a great portability.  The 100 inch screen I am using only weighs 27 pounds.  Both of which can be carried by one person.  That can not be said about a flat panel.  Flat panels are great.  I use them in smaller sizes at reasonable prices in locations they make sense.  But for a home theater you can't beat this for anywhere near the price and you will be stunned by how great the picture is from it.I can't say enough how happy I am. I took a month to research all this and made this decision.  The first time I put a show on the screen I instantly knew it was all I had hoped for.  It gets used on a daily basis and I have now used it for about 500 hours (the projector keeps track of lamp hours used) without a single issue.  In about one minute I have a projector which is always out of the way on the ceiling taking up no usable space in the room along with a screen also not taking up any usable space to having a 100 inch incredibly high resolution viewing experience night or day.  The only adjustments I make are to the projector by selecting ""Dynamic"" during the bright day time to ""Living Room"" which is slightly dimmer to avoid seeing any pixilation at night and that only takes a few seconds from the remote to change.UPDATE: I have been using this projector for over a year now.  No problems at all during this time, and still no regrets that I purchased this unit. I do find that I still prefer either an HD video source or BluRay whenever possible but that would be the same with any projector or HDTV, particularly one with a very large screen such as this is capable of. I still only use the two settings, one for daytime and one slightly less bright for night to avoid seeing any pixilation artifacts.BULB LIFE: Well my bulb finally went.  It lasted exactly 2837 hours.  Epson says that it will last between 3000-4000 hours so it was close.  Keep in mind that I have never used the Eco setting only full power.  I would urge anyone buying a replacement bulb to ONLY USE EPSON.  There are lots of knockoffs out there which are cheap and will not have the performance, life, possibly explode or other negative things.  Only the Epson lamp is worth buying.  It is of course the most expensive and I found a new one for about $60 less from another camera supply site than Amazon is offering it for right now.  But no regrets. I have had some awesome viewing of countless movies and football games and tv shows and whatever on the huge screen with a great picture for all this time.To extend the life of your lamp make sure that it has plenty of room for air to circulate around the projector, particularly the back where the air intake and filter are.  Vacuum the air filter from time to time and replace it with a new one when you change the bulb.  Also make sure to allow the lamp to cool down before moving the projector if it is not mounted on the ceiling like mine.  Those things will help give you the longest life.  I have read of people having significantly lower lamp life and I suspect they are not doing all those things.  I also have a in room air cleaner to help keep dust down in the room I have my projector and components for the home theater.  Keep it cool and clean and you will get the best lamp life.",How is the picture?,['the more control over light in the room the better the picture'],[461],[1],[0.56666666],[ True]

I've always pressed spacebars as they were meant to be pressed so I had no issues adjusting.The largest challenge with this keyboard is using home row correctly, Microsoft puts out products based on the standard, and has done this with its' Natural line since the start. I use my left hand correctly, my right, on my Logitech Elite, went all over the place; I can only imagine how wrong my right hand usage was. This keyboard forces you to relearn typing, for typing classes, a Natural keyboard would be perfect, it makes you type correctly. I don't much like the N key, but I've learned to use it and the M key correctly, no more hitting my enter key while going for quotes either.The zoom function is novelty, not necessity, it's fun to use normally but mostly useless otherwise, really exclusively for the always-in-office user, what they need to do is make it a scroll button too, it's highly sensitive and easy to use, which would make scrolling silky smooth in a way only overpriced mice manage.Therein lies the problem, the software is inferior to my cheapie Logitech Elite(Which had more functions I might add as well as better software.), there is hardly any customization to be had. There is no taskbar icon; most of the remapping done is through an interface integrated into the already well-hidden Keyboard area under the control panel. Remapping options are less than fantastic, the favorites keys are useless, the back and forward buttons will work with either a browser or a media player, not both, zoom cannot be reconfigured, and Mail only allows one indicated program to be opened.This is what is wrong with the favorite's keys, they allow but five programs to be opened, you cannot indicate that you wish to open a menu of programs to select, merely one program per key, same with all of the other keys. The lack of ""My"" keys for the F# Buttons is annoying, but that's just a design decision for a non-media keyboard, and I don't mind much.This keyboard would've done better to have more configuration and just a couple more media keys, but I suppose it's my fault for asking that much of it, it's designed for the office, not a music listeners hands. I'll go into the aesthetics of this baby now to round it off.Some may notice the shift keys are smaller, and the enter key even smaller, the right of the keyboard is larger than the left in the way of keys, which seems fine, to me at least, I find reaching the Backspace key uncomfortable, placing your hands on this keyboard is like a match made in heaven, seems a shame to reach so far away and break off from paradise.That leads me to this palm rest, wow, sick of those cheap detachable plastic palm rests(Read: Wrist Destroyers)? This is your ticket, so soft, yet strong, it's the cashmere of palm wrests. The 2x3 layout is back to normal, which I very much enjoy, insert is back home and delete is too. The keys above the numpad offer more functions that I have yet to use, but are nice to have all the same, the curvature of the keys takes getting used to, particularly the aforementioned N key and it's sibling the M key. The Alt, Ctrl, Windows, Menu, and Start keys are all gigantic and hard to miss, they feel pretty great.The spacebar, apparently if struck correctly, is amazing, it's designed for this keyboard in a way that no spacebar has ever been, it's almost destructive of what you're typing looking down while you type, seeing it all functioning the way it does, it's almost like some kind of alien technology, which is why I don't look.The...crappy plastic attachment that comes attached(Oddly enough) to this masterpiece is best taken out(Easily) and forgotten, it's all personal preference of course, I didn't like it, the slope of the keys makes leaving your hands where they are painless and then very comfortable. The prop-ups on the back make it more conventional and I rather like them, but now the size.This keyboard is undeniably the largest keyboard I have ever laid eyes on, the sheer width and height is enough to make a laptop user gawk for moments at a time, it is critical you have a large amount of desk space to place this on, I didn't, and I had to move my entire PC over more to the left just to manage a nice cozy fit. When the legs on this baby are propped it also reaches monitor height, I.E., it will not fit very well under a monitor, which is why it is best used in a keyboard tray, though I'd worry about it's large scale hurting the tray after a long enough time.In conclusion, this is a masterful piece of hardware, and it has virtually no flaws, the software is pathetic at best and obviously designed for the dullard worker drone, it's a pity really, all the same, it deserves four stars, here's to hoping they manage to improve the boring, bland software.8/10 (Not an average)",How do you like the keyboard?,['This keyboard forces you to relearn typing'],[678],[5],[0.],[False]
electronics,wireless,connection,faulty,unit,0f79f87f26f90768e5d56ca1e5dc28bc,1,0.0,False,6f9e3cde2e4117d94741c8cf3774329a,3be95ca7f79179e32a31abab502f6d78,B004T9RR6I,"(See bottom for update )I have a wired network at the house. We've tried wireless in the past, but the signal won't penetrate the walls (they are 1 "" thick concrete boards). The last try was a few years back, and we really needed to try again. Every piece of electronics we buy has a network connection. I'm tired of running cables, installing hubs, etc.  Xbox, Wii, TV's, BluRay layers, satellite boxes, printers - the list goes on. And so do the network cables.OK, I did have some install issues and had to contact customer support, so this goes on a bit.  Bottom line, after all was said and done, this thing works FANTASTIC. There is one serious security concern - the router automatically had a wide open guest connection. You can't configure this during setup, but have to do it later. ASAP change this - set a password!  Had I not had my install issue, the install would have taken under 10 minutes. On to the review....I'm typing this review as I install the router: Default setup requires that you already have a wireless connection - that's a pretty silly assumption, since you're buying a wireless router. You don't find this out until you start installation. The instructions have you plug in the router, attach it to the internet (to the back of your cable box, etc.)  - then test for a wireless connection. If it does not find a connection, you have to redo step one, move the router next to your PC, unplug your PC from the network, and plug the router into your PC and the web. OK, so I climbed the ladder, pulled the router down from the shelf I stuck it on, and plugged it into the back of my PC with a 100' cable I had on hand.  Followed the instructions on the rest of the setup screen. It's the typical wizard interface, just follow instructions and press ""Next."" So I kept pressing ""Next."" After about three minutes I received a message - Big and bold - ""Our Customer Support team can help"" - then about 70% smaller - ""Your router was not successfully set up.""  You're then pointed to a website for help and chat. Chat. No phone number. OK, so now I need to unplug the router from the back of my PC, reattach my network cable, and visit the website. If you're like me, the computer is under your desk, pretty buried.  It's a real pain to crawl under there and swap cables. Plus you have to clean up all the stuff that missed your trash can.....OK, I follow the link. It's not a help page. It's the promo page for the product. So I have to find support myself. I find live chat. Have to fill out a short form?!  Took about two minutes to start the chat. Typical BS chat questions, asking me everything I just answered on the form I had to fill out to start the chat! Man is that annoying. Plus they want the serial number. They won't even chat without that information. Obvious from the grammar that I'm chatting with a tech-center in the Far-East. Then they want to know how many computers I have and the OS. So I tell them. Then I'm asked which computer was used to install the router. That's the first pertinent question. There's also the annoying 10-20 second gap between my sending an answer and the reply.Next: Do I use DSL and who is my ISP.  Still no question about the error.  Getting really annoyed. No, I do not use DSL. Business class broadband, five dedicated IP addresses.I'm told to (cut and paste - all replies are cut and paste, including typos):1. Reset the router, press and hold the reset button found underneath the router for 5-10 seconds (until the port lights flash at the same time) to reset the router to its factory defaults.2. Temporarily disable the Firewall or Anti-virus on the computer then Run the software. Make sure that the Ethernet Cable from the modem is connected to the Internet port of the router.OK - no reset button on the bottom of the router. Follow her instructions, but I point out that I don't have a wireless connection on my PC.  I'm told I don't need one.Reset router, disable firewall and antivirus.  Install fails. ""This computer does not appear to have wireless capability""I inform the tech. The reply? ""If this computer is not wireless then it needs to be wired to the router.""  I told her this before we started.  I feel like throwing something. Like the router.I get a reply: ""We can't proceed with the installation if the router is not yet connected to your modem and this computer is not wired to one of its nummbered ports.""My reply: Are you saying I have to have the router connected to the modem and my computer to the router? The router is over 100 feet away from my computer.Answer: ""The router needs to be plugged to your modem to work.""My reply: In other words, yes. So I need to either move a computer, move the modem, or run 100 feet of cable, right?Long delay - two minutes and counting.....three minutesAnswer: ""Yes""In other words, there was no reason to deactivate the Antivirus and Firewall. And the chat was a complete waste of time. They never asked about the error, just followed a preset script/decision tree, and wasted my time.So no wireless on your PC? You need to connect your PC to the router and the router to the web, you may have some rearranging to do. Fortunately I had that extra cat 5, 100' cable. Why require wireless already be in place? This is idiotic. Bottom line: The Reset on the router was all that was needed. Install now worked.User name and password entered, updated detected and installed. Update took four minutes. Router is installed. Now to try it out! Get rid of that 100' cable, connect my PC to the network again.Well, not so fast. It appears that my PC needs a wireless card to connect directly to the router. It's setup, it's on my network - and I need to use a wireless connection to configure it? Come on!!! Look, not every PC in an office or house is going to be wireless. My configuration/final goal - replace my hubs with wireless hubs, keeping the wired connections to the computers and devices (printers, BluRay players, TV's, etc.) The only wireless devices will be Kindles and a couple of laptops.  So I have to use a wireless device to configure the router. Pathetic.Hmmm. What to do.  Open up my DroidX, download the Cisco Connect Express App, and try that.  While that was going on, I ran the WiFi analyzer app and checked the signal strength throughout the house. Wow! It's strong everywhere. Back of the house, basement, outside. But - Woah! There are two network connections available from the router - a secured connection, and a wide-open guest connection! Gotta turn that off - but I can't connect to the router. Let's try that Droid app. I turned off WiFi to save the battery... Run the app. It requires WiFi (duh) but it can't turn it on for you. So exit the app, turn on WiFi. Try and find the app. It's not under Cisco. It's not under Router. It's called simply ""Express"" - no common sense with these people! So I run the app.""Router not found.""  My kindle finds it. The DroidX finds it. The Cisco app on the DroidX can't find it. Appears that you need to manually connect to the network, then run the app. Sheesh. So I check the connections. Hey, I AM connected to the guest connection. Let's switch to the secure connection. Man, time to pay for that 25 character long, upper/lower/numeric combination I set for a password.... Connected to the secure connection. Run the Cisco app again. It asks for the admin password. Enter password. Connected. So the error message was misleading. It should have stated that a secure connection was required.Once the app runs we see:Four options: Guest Access - Wi-Fi settings - Devices - Router ManagementChange the guest settings: Require a password, set max guests. Can't set lower than 4, so I make it 4.WiFi settings: Only allows you to change name and password.Devices:Display connected devices - a list of connected devicesManually add a device - displays the router info - Name, password, securityUse WiFi protected setup - tells you how to use the protected setup button found on some devicesRouter management:Renew IP address - renews IP, asks again when you press the optionReboot - Reboots, asks again when you press the optionFirmware update - Checks for update.Router details - All router info (model #, serial #, IP address, etc.)Hardware: runs a little hot, no way of wall mounting, looks cool and sleek.Included: Cat 5 cable, 6' - Power adapter, router, install CD.Update 4-27-12: Added aTRENDnet 300 Mbps Wireless N 4-Port Media Bridge TEW-640MB (Piano Black)to my network. This bridge has the WPS button, as does the Linksys router. Connecting the two was darn right simple. I pressed the WPS button on the bridge, and used my Droid App to access the EA4500 - pressed the WPS button on the screen. A minute later, I had a secure connection.  Attached two PC's and two printers. Checked the app again - saw all the devices connected.  At first I did not like the idea of using a wireless device to control the EA4500. But, wow, is this handy! I'm crawling around under the desk, Droid in hand, controlling the EA4500, linking to the bridge.  Did the same thing with a webcam.  Love the wireless app!  Just under a month later I returned the Trendnet Media Bridge. Kept dropping the connection, slowinf down - a real pain - and it was located within sight of the router.  Picked up a Netgear bridge instead - works flawlessly.  I'm bandwidth - so I also picked up a Netgear N900 USB wireless adapter.  I constantly get 450 mbps - this is in addition to the connection through the bridge.  I have two simultaneous connections, both wireless. Hitting 550 mbps total.Another update: I had to reset the router. The software that you installed to setup the router will NOT run. You get an error that you reset the router, and that you need to install the software again. WHAT? What if you can't find the CD?  I have never heard of anything this stupid. That cost it a star.",How is the unit?,[],[],[],[],[]

Living in Texas means a base temperature indoors of about 80F for much of the year and I've had some bad issues with overheating and crashing on my previous rig when playing games.Installation on an Intel based mainboard was painless (AMD looks slightly more intimidating from the manual). In fact, it was not harder than installing a stock cooler and absolutely nothing when compared with the complexity of traditional waterbased cooling systems. It comes with pre-applied thermal paste that does the job just fine, although I suspect you could get even better cooling results with high end thermal paste. The H100 installs very conveniently in the case and does not clutter up the interior at all, which I consider a definite plus.The cooling performance of the product is excellent, and better than what Corsair advertises on the box. The difference to the stock cooler that came with my processor is dramatic, double digit degrees on all settings. The H100 has three speed settings for the fans controlled via a button located on top of the part attached to the CPU. Unless you have an easily accessible case, you will likely not be changing fan speeds very much. There's apparently an additional hardware product that can be used to control the fans from an optional front panel, but I have not found it necessary to change speed away from the minimum setting unless I seriously overlock my CPU.The noise profile of the device is great, but certainly not silent, as long as it is not set to it's maximum speed setting.Some words of caution: This cooler requires some serious space and there are not many cases on the market that will work with it outside the box. On my Level 10-GT gaming case installing it meant removing one of the 210mm fans that came preinstalled to allow installation of this one. Do yourself a favor and do some research if your case has space for the H100 (The grill slightly larger than the 2 fans attached to it).Bottom line: Excellent cooler, comparatively easy installation, decent noise profile. Easiest water-cooling solution I've ever installed. Acceptable price.",How is the unit?,[],[],[],[],[]

I needed to have a port forwarding service, which you know of if you've been reading these reviews. Without this service I could only observe my camera's feed through my home network and only on my home network.Do you need to pay for a subscription service? no! &#34;NO/IP&#34; has a free basic service with no special features that let me accomplish my requirements for a home IP camera. At first my connection wasn't working after the simple DDNS setup on NO/IP but that was my internet service provider blocking the connection through a firewall. I found online a PDF with instructions from my ISP giving me exact directions on how to allow the camera to operate freely on the network. I then typed the info from the instructions, rebooted the camera, and I WAS UP AND RUNNING.If connected to wifi, the new forwarding adress would not work, if not connected to wifi and running on 3G, the forwarding address WOULD work.BOTTOM LINE, MORAL OF THE STORY, I had everything I needed completed in less then a few hours!. The initial camera set up, IN MINUTES!I was also able to set up my gmail account to send me an alert email if motion is detected on my camera, and was able to program which days and times to send out these alerts.The IR feature works great, and the pan and tilt works great too, only downside is no zoom feature which would have been a perfect addition. The software is barebones and does the job, and I also installed an easy set up Iphone app for remote monitoring called &#34;IP Cam Viewer&#34; which only cost a few bucks, no subscription fee.Four stars to start, will be five after getting some use time in.WHO CARES ABOUT THE AUDIO?

My first impressions upon taking it out of the box were that it looked different than the pictures shown. After comparing it to the product pictures I confirmed that what I ordered was a slightly different unit than what is shown. I have posted a picture so that you can see what is different in the one I ordered compared to the original product picture & the pictures of other owners. Specifically: The USB dongle is full size, not a mini like in others pictured. The buttons below the touch pad are completely different than other pictured models. Keys are also flat & clear glossy finger print magnet plastic material, not convex matte finish like seen in other models pictured.After trying this product out for a little over 20 mins navigating the internet and doing some video playback my first impressions are that I should have invested in another (but full size) keyboard. The biggest problem I have with this product is that it will go into some sort of sleep mode (I assume to conserve battery life) which takes about 10 seconds before it will reconnect with the computer and start showing the mouse swipes & keyboard inputs. This was very frustrating while surfing the net & watching YouTube videos. I have no idea the length of time before it would power down the signal but just to give you an idea this would happen after watching a 2 min YouTube video.At first I thought it was neat how small the keyboard was but after trying to type on it I've grown frustrated with typing on the thing. Having been raised knowing how to type on the keyboard I find myself being frustrated going from 70+ wpm on the computer down to about 10 wpm because of design of this particular keyboard. The keys are grid shaped, not offset like a normal keyboard and because of the touch pad on the right it's not as easy to type on as say an Iphone because you'r right thumb has to reach considerably further to hit any of the keys. So if you're thinking that you text fast & this wouldn't be a problem consider the inch of dead space between your thumb & the keys.Lastly, & probably the most important is signal quality. I purchased this with intentions of using it for an HTPC. Sitting about 10 ft away from the computer I found that it drops keystrokes about every 5th input. The trackpad is also something highly left to be desired. I first used this on my gaming machine that I sit about 2 ft away from and noticed a slight laggy input when using the trackpad. I was a little leery that the signal was that bad sitting so close to the input but I decided to still give it a chance and plugged it into my HTPC. Increasing the distance between the USB dongle & the keyboard only increases the lag of using the trackpad.So in review: 1 star was taken off for not receiving exactly what I was shown in the product pictures. 1 star was taken off for the poor signal quality of this item even at close ranges, and 1 star is taken off for the lack of distance this allows you to have between the PC and the keyboard (in the product description it states this works within 30M which I assume they mean 30 meters. Unfortunately in a 12x12 room with nothing between me and the PC I was having signals cut out constantly. This room also has no wireless internet connection & no wireless phones).",What do you think of the artistic design?,[],[],[],[],[]

My pragmatic daughter insisted on this, since sometimes in bright light the LCD is hard to view.The camera is tiny! Even after seeing a picture of the camera hiding behind a credit card I was not prepared for how small it is! The buttons are recessed and the whole camera slips easily into a pocket without snagging on anything. Despite its small size, the LCD is easy to view, and the buttons are very usable.The second moment of awe was powering on. The camera turns on and off very quickly! Some other point-and-shoot digitals we've had have had a considerable delay before they are ready to shoot, extending the lens and running through the self-test of the software. This camera is not quite instantaneous, but it's very fast!The pictures are good quality, and it's easy to switch between photo and video mode. Another fun surprise was that the auto-focus places the camera in macro mode when you try to focus on something right in front of the lens.

This case does not add extra bulk, unlike other cases on the market, which is a plus for everyday people who travel to and from work daily and don't want to be burdened with a heavy case. The case is very sleek but will still provide more than enough protection for your daily needs. I have brought this back and forth from my house to my office ,transporting it in a briefcase and there have been no scratches or dents on my Ipad mini. The second feature I like about this case is the ease of installing it onto the Ipad mini and being able to take it off just as easily. There have been other cases in the past that were not so easy to take on and off and I ended up damaging the case and chipping the side of my ipad. The Bluetooth was more than easy to set up (directions in instruction manual) andvery responsive. The best part of this case in my opinion is the keyboard, as the layout of the keys are perfect to actually get work done and are not just there for decoration. Lastly is the way you are able to rotate the case a full 360 degrees and change the angle up to 180 degrees. This feature came in handy when I needed to show diagrams and displays to upper level management in a meeting. It looks like New Trent has done their homework in figuring out the perfect case consumers expect in this kind of market. All in all I would rate this Ipad case a 4.5 out of 5 stars as it has easily covered all of my needs and some, whether they were personal or work related. The only flaw I have is there is no protection for the screen of the Ipad, but that can be easily fixed with a screen protector. If you are looking for a fully functional and sleek case to compliment and make your Ipad life easier, buy this and you will not be disappointed.",How do I get to the port?,[],[],[],[],[]

Things, however, went bad.For some reason, I stopped being able to get to the cloud at all, from my smartphone or via any computer. I was completely shut out of any router controls. Cisco support is easy to get to, but after many back and forths, and resets and re installs, they still couldn't tell me what was wrong or what I needed to do to fix it. So, we reverted back to the original, locally based router management software. On one hand, I like having control back in my hands, but on the other, I'm not sure Cisco is ever going to update or support the old software (they seem to be headed to the cloud, like it or not).Basically, it works fine as a router and wireless device, but if you don't want to give up control of your setup to Cisco's cloud, you won't like this. If you use the cloud, there is the advantage of being able to do some configuring from your smartphone, but it may not be something you use all the time, either.",How is the experience?,['this is a product that takes away your control of your settings'],[134],[1],[0.],[False]

The texture and feel of allplastic parts are very good. A metal stand is included which is cleverlydesigned to fold out, even with the hand strap in place.The hand strap looks good but I'm not sure how much I will use it. I'mused to holding the ipad with one or two hands along the edges.Fortunately, you can adjust the strap length or remove it as necessary. Thestand rotates with the hand strap so you can set it up in any orientation.I found the case to be easy to install and it fits precisely around theipad. This case is designed to cover all the ports so you will need to foldthe covers up to access the ports underneath. Folding these covers out ofthe way is an extra step that takes some getting used to. If you arelooking to provide protection for these ports, the solution works well andlooks good.This is a 3 piece cover designed to protect the whole ipad but not add toomuch bulk. The case is surprisingly light but still provides goodprotection. The inner case is rigid and provides an integral screen guardand a full coverage frame for the outer cover. The outer cover is softerand has flexible covers for the earphone, charger, and mute buttons. Thespeakers and microphone have clear passage ways for good sound performance. Onevery nice feature is that the case does not stick up very much beyond thescreen, this makes it easy and comfortable to hold. The extra width of thecase gives you a place for your thumb and prevents you from triggering thescreen. This is very convenient when holding the screen in landscape modeA few minor concerns: 1) The screen cover is integral to the case so itdoesn't appear to be individually replaceable. 2) there is no Smart Coverfunction to turn off the screen.Overall, a very nice case that serves to fully cover the ipad-mini and yet notinterfere with it's function.",How is the grip?,[],[],[],[],[]

The kind you don't have to quibble about. It's there in abundance for any conceivable need you might have. That aside, I see this M100 as 2 headphones in one (a bargain BTW) - the extra-bass model for gaming, TV action film, house and other bass-centric music, and the hi-fi model (using bass reduction) for symphonies, folk and acoustic, jazz, rock/pop/metal, and other such delicate genres. Unless otherwise noted, all comments below apply to the M100 using bass reduction, since I listen to music in quiet places mainly, and my tastes are mostly midrange-centric.The M100's sound is slightly dark, having 1-2 db less output in the presence area around 3-5 khz and more output in the upper bass than many other full-size headphones (ex: Beyer COP, B&O; H6, Senn MOE). Some of the other dark-sounding headphones I have don't compete with the M100, because they don't have the clarity and accuracy of musical tone that comes with the higher quality drivers and manufacturing standards that the M100 benefits from. Despite the impression of 'dark', the overall sound is quite lush, and very smooth from top to bottom. Although I stated above that all of the comments from here down apply to using bass reduction with the M100, I must repeat here that with bass reduction on, the bass is as strong as any good hi-fi headphone that has good bass. Some of the so-called 'neutral' headphones will have bass that's significantly weaker than the M100 even when the M100 bass is reduced, so I think the concept of hi-fi neutral is overdue for a revision.Some reviews I've read describe the M100's midrange as recessed, but of course that's with the default bass as I noted above. How you perceive the midrange depends a lot on where you play the M100. Outdoors, on public transport, in a noisy club - those environments tend to absorb most of the bass, so the M100 should be ideal in those cases when played flat (no EQ). Listening at home late at night when it's very quiet is where you'll hear the most detail, since the background noise level can be 30 or more db lower than outdoors in the daytime, and even a lot lower than the indoor daytime noise level. In summary, excellent sound for high fidelity music playback, if you follow my reasoning. Soundstage is mostly dependent on the music of course, but frequency balance plays a large role as well - since most reviewers are adamant about not using EQ, when they evaluate the M100 in their very quiet listening locations, the strong bass makes the midrange seem more distant, hence the soundstage follows from there.Isolation seems quite good, but most isolation is at the higher frequencies, so loud noises from air conditioners or dishwashers etc. may intrude if your music is soft and quiet. Leakage is low, but if you're in a very quiet office in a cubicle right next to other cubicles and you play your music loud, someone in the next cube may hear your music faintly, and some people are bothered by the least bit of leakage that way. It's very doubtful that leakage from the M100 would be noticeable to anyone on a noisy bus, train, or plane.My first M100 was pearl white, and this one is matte black. The sound seems about the same a year after the first one I had, and the fit is very similar also. But just in case I had the impression of a tight fit with my first M100, this current M100 is ultra-comfortable - so much so that I'm wearing it for hours at a time with no adjustments. The sound is so good (as described above) that I'm enjoying classical, jazz, electronic, rock, and other genres of music like never before - everything from Daft Punk, David Chesky, and David Lynch sounds just as spectacular as Michael Buble, Korn, and Miles Davis.The M100 in matte black (my color choice) is beautiful, and its military-gear stealth look is not only very classy, it doesn't tend to show dirt and grime. The military-grade look isn't just superficial though - the build quality is the best in the headphone business - all metal and perfectly finished, but not heavy on the head. At the time I purchased the M100, an extra set of metal earcup side plates was offered, with choice of color and even a custom logo. Those custom plates aren't expensive and they can be attached or detached at any time, so if the headphone is transferred to another person that person can use the standard side plates instead. Headband clamping force with the M100 is very moderate for a full-size headphone, and if the headband were ever to become uncomfortable on top of a user's head, I suggest pulling the earcups down an extra click so most of the weight is borne by the earcups.The earpads go completely around my ears, unlike some headphones that are described as circumaural (around the ear). The Sennheiser Momentum is one such headphone where the earpads sit partially on my average-size ears. The earpads are very soft and spongy, covered in 'pleather' I would guess, and are the most comfortable type of earpad I've used. The M100 has a single-sided detachable cable that can be plugged into either the left or right earcup. The fabric-covered cable is terminated with a 45-degree angled Apple miniplug, and the end that goes into the earcup is a standard (non-Apple) miniplug. In case of cable failure, any generic miniplug to miniplug cable could be used, as long as the sleeve ahead of the plug that goes into the earcup is no bigger than 7mm in diameter.The 4-foot cable has a one-button control with mic about 13 inches down from the earcup, and an additional mic about 4 inches down from the earcup. A second (7-foot) cable is included, having the same plugs as the 4-foot cable, but no controls or microphone. The 7-foot cable also has a short (3.5 inches) extension on the end in a 'Y' configuration, where you can plug a second headphone in. I didn't try it, but I wonder what the effect on the sound would be if you plugged two 18-ohm headphones into a music player using this cable. It seems like that would create a 9-ohm load for the music player, or even less if the minimum impedance of the headphones were less than 18 ohms. The M100 comes with a small zippered carrycase that's suitable for backpacks and airline carry-on bags.In previous reviews I've included the following music examples with comments about how the headphones sound with each track. My suggestion is instead of reading each one as an absolute unto itself, you could compare my notes here to those other reviews and see how the M100 compares with each individual track. Note that the comments below apply to the M100's sound played with Bass Reducer EQ as noted above.Animotion - Obsession (1980's New Wave/Techno): The upper bass synth has good detail and tone, and both male and female vocals sound natural, without favoring either. The M100 plays this perfectly.Ben Heit Quartet - Suite-Magnet and Iron (Jazz with a Bebop flavor): The piano that leads off sounds realistic, and the sax is soft. The M100 plays this music extremely well.Cath Carroll - Moves Like You (1980's New Wave/Techno): This track's percussion and voice is crisp and well-balanced, and there's a good sense of space or soundstage around the voices and instruments. The M100 reproduces the space and detail convincingly, although if this is played very loudly the percussion may be too bright.Chromatics - I'm On Fire (Synth-Pop, female lead): Another track with plenty of space around the voice and instruments. The voice and high-frequency percussion (tambourine especially) sounds natural with no harshness. The M100 plays this music perfectly.Crystal Castles - Wrath of God (Electro-Pop): The moderate level of bass in this track has good detail, and the ambient electronic effects maintain their separation and never congeal into a glassy, hard, or ""ringy"" sound as some headphones do if they have uncorrected resonances. The M100 plays this track just right.DJ Shadow - Building Steam With a Grain of Salt (Electronic/DJ): This track opens with what sounds like very high and very low piano notes, and those high notes particularly might ring a few resonances in lesser headphones. The M100 handles those notes well, and reproduces the ambient voices with good tone and balance.Franz Ferdinand - Ulysses (Pop-Rock): The moderate level of bass in this track has good detail, and the percussion and voice are crisp and well-balanced. The M100 makes this sound like what I imagine the original producers heard when they mixed it.Halie Loren - Sway (Jazz vocal): Bass instrument(s) here may sound boomy with some headphones, but the M100 handles this perfectly. The trumpet sounds natural but soft, and the voice has the right presence without sounding recessed or too forward. The M100 does a great job in both respects.Hans Zimmer - Dark Knight-Aggressive Expansion (Soundtrack): The percussion hits hard here, and the M100 handles it well. The bass tones beginning around 0:45 into the track are the ultra-deep ""shuddery"" kind that require good deep bass response from a headphone, and the M100 delivers on those.Kaskade - 4am (Electro-House): The bass that kicks in around 1:01 into the track is subtle, but the M100 gets it right. The percussion and female voice balance well with neither overwriting the other. The M100 aces this.Katy B - Perfect Stranger (R&B-House-Garage;): The heavy bass that begins at 0:27 into this track is played very well by the M100. The voice is slightly forward, but it doesn't overpower the instruments or get lost in the mix. The M100 balances the different elements in this music extremely well.Machine Gun Kelly - All We Have (Rap/Hip-Hop): The heavy bass beats that begin at 0:23 into the track sound like drum impacts, although they're not sharp impacts. The male and female voices have a good balance and don't overpower the music or sound recessed. The M100 plays this as good as can be expected given the limited quality of the recording.Massive Attack - Angel (Trip-Hop): This track begins with a steady low-frequency sound and some solid deep-bass impacts. The voices blend well with the music and have just the right presence, although the recorded quality of the instruments isn't great. The M100 plays this very well given the limited quality of the recording.Morcheeba - Bullet Proof (Trip-Hop): Bright percussion and medium-strength bass impacts make up most of this, with some dance-club spoken intonations thrown in. The M100 renders the percussion treble correctly (bright, but not harsh), and the voices sound just right.Peter Tosh - Get Up Stand Up (Reggae): The bass here has a decent but moderate impact, and the lead and backup voices have good separation that's not too narrow or wide. The M100 renders the bass with good detail and the voices sound very natural.Porcupine Tree - Trains (Pop-Rock): This track opens with some detailed string sounds and a forward-sounding male voice with a higher-than-average register. There are also some ""clip-clop"" effects starting at 3:19 that should sound like they were made with wooden blocks of some kind. The M100 reproduces all of these sounds faithfully.Rachmaninoff - Prelude in C-Sharp Minor Op3 No2 (Classical, Piano): Grand piano played mechanically from an original recording by the master himself. The bass is light here, but the piano tone is good quality. The M100 plays this track very well.Scarlatti-Kipnis - Sonata in E Major K381 (Classical, Harpsichord): The harpsichord here is fairly bright and highly detailed, and the M100 renders the tones and transients superbly.Trombone Shorty - Backatown (Jazz-Funk): The deep bass impacts here are unusually strong, and work very well with the horns and other instruments. The M100 delivers the impacts with proper weight, and makes the horns sound real.William Orbit - Optical Illusion (Billy Buttons Mix) (Electronic): This is about as close as I want to get to easy-listening music. The string tones beginning at 0:18 are subtle, but clearly reproduced by the M100. The bass isn't very strong, but still adds a good underpinning to the music. The short poetic rap at 4:14, preceded by an etherial female voice, sounds so perfect that this track could easily have been mixed using the M100 headphone.",How is the sound?,[],[],[],[],[]

I originally was going to get the 24-70mm f/2.8 lens, but someone in one of the forums suggest I look at this one.  Though I lost a stop of light, I was very much sold on the IS idea (hands shake) and the cost difference between the two allowed me to invest in the Canon 430 EX II flash, which was something else I really needed to invest in, so I decided the trade-off was worth it for my purposes.I've been using the lens now for about a week, experimenting with the IS, the focus, depth of field, etc.  I wanted to be pretty sure I knew what it could do before I wrote a review.Focus and focal range:  my camera focuses very quickly with this lens, and the full-time manual focus is great for those moments when the camera ""guesses wrong"" and focuses on, say, the post beside the bird instead of the bird itself.  I was pleased that 24-105 is workable as an indoor lens on a crop sensor camera.  I didn't run into any ""have to back up to get that picture"" moments so far.  It definitely isn't an ultra-wide lens on a crop sensor body, but can be used comfortably every day.  The zoom works well for the across the room zooms when you're trying to just get the subject's face in the camera, making this a great choice as a walk-around lens for most people photography.Sharpness:  I bought this at the same time as the 70-200mm f/2.8L IS USM lens, so I have a much sharper lens (the 70-200mm f/2.8L IS II is a definite ""wow"" lens) to compare it to, so I will say this lens is acceptably, moderately sharp without a lot of post-processing.  Not as sharp as the 70-200mm f/2.8L lens (it also costs half as much), but sharper than the kit lens and the 55-250mm lens that I had with my T1i, requiring less post-processing to get a sharp image.  The colors are rich and the contrast is excellent, creating a pleasing image.Build quality and feel: if you are someone coming from the consumer lens category you will immediately notice the difference.  From the weight of the lens to the ""feel"" of the focus and zoom rings and the more quiet, assured zoom you realize there are reasons why L glass costs more beyond just the research and engineering required to make a higher quality image.  The IS also runs more quietly than the IS in the consumer-level lenses.  The lens is built dust and weather resistant, meaning that it can stand up to a little weather here and there, etc.  Additionally it comes with a pouch and lens hood included.  Unlike what I can research about the consumer hoods, the lens hood on L-glass comes with a flocked interior, which absorbs light better than the plain matte-black plastic.I am very pleased with my choice, and would definitely probably do the same thing again without hesitation.  Now I am debating between the 16-35mm f/2.8L II and the 17-40mm f/4L.

On the other hand, I did see that a leaked version of the 3.1 upgrade is out on the web today, so we should be getting that upgrade soon, and it sounds like a lot of enhancements are in that update.One other thing of note, is that I picked up a wireless usb keyboard for use with the A500, and it worked fine for me, but my wife was trying to use it with blogger and she said she was having problems with it.

I love having a tablet around, it is much quick to just pick it up and use it instead of having to wake up/start up my computer.  I use this for most of my web browsing now when I am at home, and I also take the tablet to work and use it for music via bluetooth (works perfectly with my sony DR-BT50 headphones).HDMII have also purchased an hdmi cable for the tablet and that works awesome.  When you plug in the hdmi cable, it will automatically start mirroring the display, and the sound worked through the TV speakers as expected.  I have noticed that since the resolution on the A500 is 1280x800 it cuts off part of the top and bottom when it is connected to my tv, which runs it at 720p (1280x720).  This is a minor annoyance because I was able to share videos and other content quickly and easily with the tablet, where as with my laptop, it never seems to work as nice.Sound & DisplayThe sound on the tablet is really good, I was kind of surprised, for such a small thing to have such good sound.  I am not saying I would want to listen to my music over the speakers, my headphones are much better for that, but for sharing music or videos with people around it works pretty well.  The display is fine, good, but not great.  I think the colors and brightness are fine, but my phone seems better (Galaxy S phone).  The viewing angle is good, and easily sharable with a person sitting next to you.Apps & SoftwareI really like Honeycomb (Android 3), the G-mail client is much better.  The browser is fine, but it is a little on the sluggish side.  I planned on using this to replace a laptop for surfing the web while moving around the house, and it is good for that, but I can tell that the browser is just not as fast as the laptop on the same network, so I think it might be a little underpowered by comparison.  Most sites load with the full site and not a mobile site (wired for some reason always gives me the mobile... grrrr), and that makes it a much better experience.  The on-screen keyboard is ok, I am so used to using swype on my phone, that I miss it when using the A500, but I haven't tried to install it yet.  As for the other apps in the android market, I have loaded a bunch of the non-tablet apps, and they seem to work fine for me.  Most of them scale great (including angry birds, which is huge on a 10.1"" screen).  I have also picked up a few tablet only versions, and they worked just as well.HardwareOverall the tablet seems zippy, I haven't noticed any slowdowns when running regularly, though I did get choppy video when trying to use a 720p video on You Tube while connected to HDMI.  I haven't tried that again, but I have a feeling it just was too much for the tablet.  Anyway I love that it has the HDMI port, and the USB micro in for transferring data over, and a normal usb for a keyboard, or flash drives.WIFIThe wifi works just ok, the signal strength doesn't seem as good as a normal laptop, but it is about the same or possibly a little better than my Galaxy S phone.  I have also had times where sitting 10 feet from the router I kept loosing the signal, but after a reboot, it seemed to work fine.  I have also wifi tethered the A500 to my phone, and that worked out great.  Basically you just turn on wifi-tether on the phone, and the A500 saw it as an access point right away.  The only bad part is that it does suck the phone's battery very quickly.  I did this while out camping (sadly only getting E :( and not 3G), and it made the trip a lot nicer than trying to use my phone like I had in the past for e-mail and catching up in reader.Now for the downers....So I mentioned that there were a couple of problems, and they will probably all be fixed via software updates.  First off I had a heck of a time using the market when I first purchased the A500.  It would get stuck when it was suppose to download something.  I finally did a wipe of the data (fresh install again), and I had the same problem.  I realized that I had clicked on the update for google maps when it first loaded up, and after another wipe, I went to the market first, and had to accept the agreement, and then everything worked fine.  So, click on the Market icon first and accept the terms.*FIXED* -- Another thing that is annoying is that the screen keeps popping on when the tablet is not in use.  I was reading on some of the forums, that if you turn off wifi, or put the tablet in airplane mode, that it would stop doing this.  It seems to be that when it tries to do data updates in the background, it turns the screen on.  This is a minor annoyance, but it keeps the screen waking up, and it sucks battery.I have also had a one lockup that I had to hold down the power button till it turned off, and then turned it back on.  And once where the browser wouldn't load anything after clicking on a link in the google reader app.  I had to reboot the table to get this fixed.OverallI really like the tablet, and I think the issues I had above, will all be fixed by software updates as honeycomb becomes more mature.  I had a G1 when it first came out, and it was pretty much a mess when at the beginning.  As the software updates came along, it worked much better.  Using the tablet as a replacement for a laptop, works pretty good for surfing the web, and watching videos and such, though it could use more power in the browser area.  The battery life is better than my phone, but that just isn't saying much.  I really like the options that it presented (like the USB and HDMI ports), and the screen resolution, which is why I purchased this over the Asus transformer (need the dock for a normal usb port), and it was much cheaper than the Xoom(Verizon or WIFI) or G-Slate (T-Mobile), or the iPad2.  I also was more interested in an Android tablet over an iOS tablet, because I use a lot of Google services (GMail, Docs, Calendar, Reader, etc), and they work better on Android than they seem to on iOS, so it is much more convenient for me.  I bet within 3-6 months I will have to upgrade this to a 5 star review, but with the software problems as they are now, I just can't do it, even though I wouldn't get rid of the A500.",What is the price of the display?,[],[],[],[],[]

If you find a make/model that runs reliably, you love that make/model.  If you have a bad experience (or two, or three) with a make/model, you hate that make/model.  That said, Seagate hasn't failed me over the years.  So I love this hard drive.Background:  We're moving into a blended, Apple-Microsoft home, as are many other families these days.  It starts maybe with an Apple iPod, then iPod Touch, then an iPhone, then you start eyeing those sleek Macs at the Apple store, and then....  But we're not ready to move to an all-Apple home anytime soon.  Wouldn't it be nice to be able to move data back-and-forth between those two environments when you're dealing with lots of files?What I appreciate about this Seagate is the Windows driver that Seagate provides on their website to allow you to connect this ready-for-Mac hard drive to any Windows computer.  Google ""Seagate crossplatform"" to find the Windows driver to use this Seagate on a Windows machine.  Note, though, that whenever I connect this drive to Windows, it throws the warning, ""Do you want to scan and fix Seagate Backup Plus Drive?""  If you click Yes, nothing happens -- no apparent way to get rid of this message.  That doesn't appear to affect the ability to read/write to the drive using Windows, though.Speed and performance seemed good.  Using a 1.7GB test directory, I got 24MB/sec write, and 38MB/sec read using USB 2.0.CONCLUSION:  I love Seagate...until this or another Seagate drive fails me.",How is the value of this package?,[],[],[],[],[]

The verdict is in- this cable is a very high quality cable which works beautifully with no problems at all.Despite it being thick and a little tricky since you can not bend it at a sharp angle, it is easy to work with by looping a bit as the 6+ft of cable gives us plenty of room to do so, but I would advise you to check out any holes in furniture or other small areas that the cords might have to pass through to be sure you have enough room to pass this cable through if there is any question- BEFORE you install it.We have checked this cable with various devices- PS3, HDTV, Blu-Ray player and most recently it is being used from a high quality amplifier to a very high level audio-visual computer system.  In all cases, the picture/sound has been top notch, with no disintegration of information flow or integrity of signal.The quality of this cable is definitely high and equals or surpasses the performance of cables that are much more expensive on the market but have brand names that people are more familiar with.

It's an excellent improvement over the Airbender 2.0.  The Airbender Pro has a thick and very protective rubber case that protects the iPad Air and the bluetooth keyboard.  It's somewhat thick, which helps to make it extra protective.  It protects all the ports and has a built in screen protector.  It also has holes for the speakers so you can still listen to music.  The case is shock and water resistant.  It is not water proof.  It would be really great to have a waterproof case.  If I am outside in the snow or rain and want to use my iPad, it would be nice to have it in a waterproof case.  The bluetooth keyboard is a full keyboard.  It pairs easily with the iPad Air.  It's very easy to type on.  The keys are comfortable.  It could use a mouse.  If the keyboard was rearranged, and the keys were moved up, there would be room for a laptop style mouse or a pencil eraser style mouse.  The way in which the port coverings attached to the case seem somewhat flimsy, like they could fall off after a few months of everyday use.  The keyboard has an internal battery and can be charged using a micro USB.  The battery will last all day long.  I use this case and keyboard everyday, both at home and at work.  I perform Human Resources and Payroll functions at my job.  I do a lot of work on the Internet and send and receive a plethora of email throughout the day.  This case would be great for anyone in any occupation that needs a bluetooth keyboard for their iPad Air and a protective case.  This case really turns the iPad Air into a mini laptop.  I have gotten several really nice compliments from co-workers about how attractive the case is and how useful it is.  This case has a really rugged metal arm that won't break like the plastic arms that some of the cases have.  With this protective case on my iPad Air, I feel that I can take it more places.  It's also more usable with the keyboard.  Sometimes the bluetooth keyboard does make my iPad freeze up when I check my email on Microsoft Exchange.  Other than that the keyboard has been great.  Sometimes if I let the iPad sit for awhile, it will lose its connectivity to the bluetooth keyboard and I have to reconnect.  I give this case and keyboard a rating of 4 out of 5 stars.  This is definitely an excellent improvement over the Airbender 2.0.  The case on the Airbender 2.0 was thin and flimsy.  The Airbender Pro is awesome, durable, and rugged.  It is definitely built to last.  I highly recommend this case to anyone with an iPad Air.

I tried to program the old Marantz RC2000, but my wife could never figure out how to use it. I bought an early Pronto, but gave up when it couldn't tell if my TV was already on when I switched from cable to VCR, turning off the TV--and my wife couldn't figure it out. Several years ago, I bought a Harmony, the model number escapes me, but the screen was on the bottom and I had to scroll through menus, etc. It didn't do it for me either--and my wife couldn't figure it out.Finally, I began to search the net to see if things had improved since 2003. I ran across the Harmony ""One"" in a ""First Look"" from the CES and it seemed like it might be the ticket. The 880 came up as a good alternative when the ""One"" hadn't been released yet. I figured I'd order the 880 from Amazon, see if it worked. If it didn't, I'd send it back within the 30 days and order the ""One"".The 880 is great! I received it, logged on, set it up with all my components (Sony 52"" XBR4 LCD TV, Sony STR-DA5200ES receiver, DirecTv HR-20 HD DVR/Receiver, XBox 360 w/HD DVD drive (by the way, during the setup, the website asked me if my XBox 360 was standalone or had the HD-DVD drive as well--a real surprise), and a couple of other VCR/DVD/CD players/recorders), and have been having fun tweaking it the past 2 days. I did not experience any of the difficulties described in some of the other reviews. It sits in the cradle perfectly. The buttons are smaller than some remotes, but it makes it easy to reach most of them with my thumb holding it in one hand. I'm a big guy with a big hand. I don't like the numbers on the bottom, but something has to be on the bottom, and I use the numbers less often than the volume, channel up/down, mute, previous, joystick and transport keys.Before I ordered it, I wondered if it would have all the keys for my DVR without going through a hierarchy of menus. It has everything right on top, even a ""List"" soft button on the LCD readout when in ""Watch DirecTv"" activity. Pushing ""List"" shows me the programs I've recorded, and using the joystick allows me to select or delete just as the DirecTv remote does. Perfect.You can change the ""Activity"" names, such as from the default ""Watch PVR"" to ""Watch DirecTv""; you can do away with cute icons behind each activity if it seems cluttery; in short, it's doing its job.I will keep the original remotes available for some of the really esoteric commands I might use occasionally. The 880 probably will do all those things through its menus, but I use them so seldom that it just isn't an issue.And my wife loves it!!",Where do I place the button on the measurement pattern?,[],[],[],[],[]

If your desk gets as dirty as mine, you'll understand why the first time you lose it)- Tracks get dirty quickly- Troubleshooting software requires a mouse -.-Overall, this is a great mouse, if only a little overpriced. But this is the only option, so I suppose Logitech would jack the price up a bit. If you're like me, and have been using this type of mouse since before you were potty trained, you'll want to get it. The range is about 15 feet, assuming no obstacles, and the response time is good enough for average gamers and home users. But really, if you're comparing response times, you should be going for a wired mouse (usually).Just a note on Logitech's support. I've had mixed experiences with Logitech's support, having been an original Revue owner. Recently though, I had to put in for the warranty on this device, as it was acting up and losing connection when it was used for long periods of time. Their support times were amazing, and after going through a few troubleshooting steps and giving them some personal info, they put in for a replacement.

MicroSD cards have no write-protect tab, so I was quite surprised and worried by this.  After failing to find any workable solution by searching online, I finally put it in my Chromebook and created a new folder on it there, then stuck it back in my Windows PC and it no longer gave me a write-protect error.  If anyone has a similar problem, I'd recommend doing something similar by putting it in any other PC, laptop, camera, etc you have available and try writing to it there.----------------------------------------------This portion of my review is necessarily being written as an update to my original review of the 64 GB version of this card, since Amazon disallows multiple reviews for what they consider the same item.  This portion concerns the 128 GB version of this card:I don't need a fast card, so the speeds on this card were not that important, besides which my test PC is not exactly high-end. Therefore I didn't count off for the speed results I got below, using a USB 2.0 card adapter, but I thought they might be relevant to some readers. While the card did reach the Class-10 and/or UHS-I requirements, it came in at under 2/3 of the claimed ""read speeds up to 30 MB/s for fast file transfer.""  Then again, running on a second PC using a different USB 2.0 card reader, none of the speeds even hit 5 MB/s, so this seems to be highly system-dependent.I only just got the card this week, and so far it works on *select* SDXC-compatible devices and exFAT-compatible operating systems:  some SDXC-compatible devices, such as the Panasonic HDC-TM40, do not allow cards larger than 64 GB (for whatever reason); this was stated in the manual, and I've confirmed this card is recognized as broken/corrupt/unusable in that device, whereas 64 GB exFAT cards work fine.  The 128 GB works fine (with original exFAT formatting) in my Toshiba Excite 7.7 Android tablet, and (predictably) not at all in my non-SDXC-compatible Galaxy Note 2 (though it possibly would if reformatted to FAT32, since a 64 GB card in FAT32 works fine there).I'll update my review to reflect any problems, issues, etc that I notice in the coming days & weeks.-----------------------------------------------------------------------CrystalDiskMark 3.0.3 (C) 2007-2013 hiyohiyoCrystal Dew World : [url removed as per Amazon rules]-----------------------------------------------------------------------* MB/s = 1,000,000 byte/s [SATA/300 = 300,000,000 byte/s]Sequential Read : 18.694 MB/sSequential Write : 11.921 MB/sRandom Read 512KB : 18.502 MB/sRandom Write 512KB : 0.680 MB/sRandom Read 4KB (QD=1) : 3.339 MB/s [ 815.1 IOPS]Random Write 4KB (QD=1) : 1.581 MB/s [ 386.1 IOPS]Random Read 4KB (QD=32) : 3.151 MB/s [ 769.4 IOPS]Random Write 4KB (QD=32) : 1.564 MB/s [ 381.8 IOPS]Test : 1000 MB [G: 0.0% (0.0/119.1 GB)] (x5)Date : 2014/04/24 16:53:49OS : Windows XP Professional SP3 [5.1 Build 2600] (x86)-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The following is my original review of the 64 GB version of this card, published April 24, 2013:This is a high-quality card.  I've used it in a variety of devices, through multiple readers on different pcs, in an HD camcorder using a micro to full-sized SD adapter, and I've never once had a problem with it.  It even works at full capacity in *some* microSDHC-only devices once its reformatted to FAT32 (such as my SanDisk Clip+ FLAC player and supposedly even PSPs via a proper adapter, though I haven't yet tested my PSP).  I keep anticipating someone coming out with a card with equal or better capacity and speeds at a comparable price, but I haven't seen one yet.  If these were cheaper, I'd have several by now.Make sure your device can handle micro or full-sized SDXC cards, or is one of those rare gems that state they support only as high as SDHC but have been tested to work with SDXC cards such as this one once they've been manually reformatted to FAT32.",How can I get good things at this hotel?,[],[],[],[],[]

The monitor is packaged very well and arrived as expected.  There are good reviews on it.  Let me add a few things that I never saw listed.This is my fifth IPS monitor purchased in the last eight years.  I don't waste my time on TN glass.  Several things led me to the purchase of the Asus monitor: Overall good reviews, no coating smudges and the color gamut, and the USB 3.0 ports.  I considered the PA246Q monitor for a few more dollars but chose this one for the USB ports.It worked perfectly out of the box and the first noticable difference was the color.  It is incredible and it puts the colors on my old Gateway FPD2485W monitor to shame.  They run next to each other, the Gateway turned up for vertical use.  The Asus also runs much cooler - warm to the touch and nothing close to the Gateway furnace.  I suspect that it the LED that makes the difference.It had some unexpected surprises.  First, the bezel surrounding the screen is smaller.  The stand is well built and very sturdy. The monitor cannot wiggle around.  You can read about the ports.  And it has the picture-in-picture feature of the Asus 246Q monitor; somethingthat is not listed in Amazon's description of the product.  Better yet, I plugged in my USB 3.0 portable hard drive; it powered up easily and my computer quickly recognized it.  I used it all day with no problems.  I had not expected that.Setup is easy.  The colors are accurate.  I love the 5-way rocker switch.  I love the different adjustments it allows.  I suppose if there is a downside it would be that it is extremely bright even at the lowest settings.  But my aging eyes see it well and I am getting used to it.  White leans toward the blue part of the spectrum (LED again) but changing colors does not affect the white color or the black.  A black background on your screen seems ""shiny"" and deep compared to flatter monitors but it is easily covered with a dark grey or light black background.  The colors are so fantastic one might as well use photos instead.At 6ms refresh, there is no noticable ghosting in games.  That is pretty quick for an IPS monitor.  And again the colors make the game so much more immersive.Considering the fact that I spent over $600 on my last IPS monitor, I am going to buy another one and run them side by side.  My only disappointment was that Amazon lowered the price by $45 the day after it arrived.  Talk about bad luck.  Still, it is a great deal.

Watching videos with these speakers has opened up an entirely new (and great) listening experience!- To test the unit's power, I turned the volume on full blast (with the computer volume turned on full as well) and the sound was pretty much flawless.  I didn't hear any rattling or feedback. These speakers are pretty loud, and definitely loud enough for what I need.Negative:- The cords are a little short, but not too short as to be annoying.- The unit is large (the entire set weighs about 22 lbs). This means that moving the speakers and subwoofer is a little inconvenient. I am used to moving speakers around with my laptop. I really can't do this with these speakers.Overall, this is a great speaker system, and I am glad I upgraded from the cheap speakers. Until now, I didn't know what I was missing using cheaper speakers. I plan on using these speakers any time I watch a video, listen to music, or play games. Their loud and rich sound has turned my computer into a powerful stereo system (I want to throw a party just to show them off!). If you want to take your listening to the next level, these speakers are for you.",Do you think it is a good cooling system?,[],[],[],[],[]

However, having played every generation of Console from the Atari 2600 to the present, made passing up the chance to buy one on launch day hard to resist. So, I got the email notification that the PS4 was now on sale and I pulled the trigger.First, I'm not a hardcore gamer by any means and my consoles are reserved for platformers, sports games, and racing games with FPS and RPGs being pushed to the PC. To me, the console is supposed to be fun first and foremost and if for any reason it fails to live up to that billing then, it fails as a console. With that said, let me get right into my review.ENGINEERING AND DESIGNThe console is slim, the graphics are fast enough, and the design is really sharp.It is a pretty nice piece of hardware and it delivers some pretty nice image quality but, in terms of computing power, most mid-range computers with discrete graphics are as strong or stronger but, that's now why you would buy a console.  You buy a console for simplicity and convenience and Sony manages to do fairly well with the design in these areas.CONTROLSYou know, I never had an issue with the past PlayStation controllers outside of the fact that they were too lite and felt more fragile than they actually were. The PS4 Dual Shock controllers feel really good and have a decent amount of weight to them in your hand.The touch pad on the controller is a little awkward in that it serves a function but, it was almost like they added it as a me too kind of feature when they saw the Wii U controller (it is better than people give it credit for). I guess we might see more use for it in the future but, I've only used it for Escape Plan (Indy Title) killzone Shadow Fall (Awkwardly too I might add).The options button, does just what it says, it brings up a menu of features or options for every aspect of the system. It just works and I find no fault with this other than it is a rebadged select button.The share button, I'm dumbfounded by this button, yeah it is cool but, really??? All I can do is share on Facebook or Twitter with it! It's baffling to say the least as I don't see either of those as being the place where people upload videos very often. Where is the YouTube or Daily Motion options Seriously, it is confusing at best unless you're going to live stream your game play (Let's not even talk about the added uselessness of the poor quality videos it records or the HDCP Copy Protection even when gaming).This voice control isn't very good on this console.  First, you won't even know it has the option if you don't plug the mic in to the controller or connect the camera.  Second, there are all of like 8 commands and those only accept a limited number of variables.  Third, I often had to say PlayStation twice even though the mic was literally right next to my mouth!The controller is decent overall but, the voice controls are average at best.The one caveat is that the Xbox One brought Kinect Interaction with voice commands in many 3rd party titles ad those developers actually left them in the Game for the PS4 versions of the games and these do work well.INTERFACEThis is one area where Sony has learned from the PS3.They broke the settings, messaging, and other features off to their own section of the main screen and that works great for me.  This is a big plus over the previous generation.The biggest downsides appear to be in their decision making process.They gave you the ability to upgrade the drive so, you can put a 3 TeraByte drive into the machine but, all of your apps install to the center line on the console and that could honestly become huge and unmanageable (Even if the most recently used are in the front).  What makes this even more bizarre is the fact that this very line has a folder called Library but, do they put everything in there?  Nope, just the digital stuff!  Why?  Seriously, move all the apps to this folder and let us choose what's on the main screen!Another flaw is in the Battery Meter implementation.  When you first sign in to the console, yhe meter is in the upper right hand side of the screen and disappears...  After that you tap the PS button and WTF??? nothing happens??? You then learn you have to hold the PS button in, go all the way to the log out screen and you find the meter again but, it isn't in the upper right as large as day!!! Nope, it is now a tiny icon in the lower right near your name.  Not sure what they were thinking here but, this is poor design.LAUNCH GAMESThis is a big area where I feel like Sony dropped the ball as most games are only slightly above average and none of them (even to this day) will blow you away or make you feel like you've gotten your money's worth from the system.Killzone: Shadow FallThis is pretty much a straight up FPS where the opening cityscapes look very cool but, the game isn't free roaming at that point so you can look but don't touch...  As you get further into the game some of the visual quality degrades fast (The flowing river looks like it is from the Quake 1 days before the Monster 3D).  For the most part, I've found the game boring to say the least even if it does look stunning in parts.KnackThis is a pretty much a hack and slash 3/4 overhead platformer and honestly it has gotten mistreated by the media.  The game is actually a lot of fun but, not as visually pleasing as its other launch siblings.  This game represents the realization that good looking does not always mean most fun and to me, I'm relearning this with this generation of consoles.ResogunThis was a PSN freebie and while it is cool, it is pretty much a copy of the Classic title Defender on Steroids so, if you liked Defender, you'll likely love this game.  I had some fun playing it but, like Defender, I never really got into it.PLAYSTATION NETWORKThe PSN has only a fraction of the servers that Xbox Live has and this was something I hadn't realized when I purchased the PS4. While this hadn't been a big issue since launch, it became a much larger issue with the opening of all those Christmas consoles as the past week has had a lot of lag when trying to play games online and even making a connection is sometimes a challenge.The plus side to the network is that you can use Amazon Prime, Netflix, and other streaming apps without having a membership to PlayStation Plus where as Xbox requires a Live Gold membership to even use those apps.Another benefit is the fact that you get free games that are yours as long as you keep a membership with PS+.Also, game sharing is a feature of the PSN network but, you have to login to the other persons console to download the games to it is kind an awkward sharing feature that isn't very practical.A PS Plus membership does allow up to 5 accounts to play games online but, only the primary member has cloud sync capability and this creates an issue when a company like EA screws up and writes all saved campaign data to the cloud.  With the Xbox Live, you everybody gets access to your Live Gold service and all of its features so, everybody gets the cloud on Xbox One.INTERFACEThe Sony interface is pretty straight forward and familiar to most.There are two rows of icons where the first row is pretty much set and it will always be the same regardless of what is installed on the system. The second row is where your library and games are stored and honestly, this row is kind of annoying because you everything you install forms one giant horizontal row of apps and games and that to me is out of control!Overall it is pretty simple to use, in some ways it is easier than Xbox One but, not in others.For instance, they gave you the battery indicator but, it appears one place when launching the system and another entirely when using the system, that's really poor for continuity if you ask me.CUSTOMER SERVICEHere's where the wheels fall off the console! The previously mentioned issues with NBA 2K14 are a big enough issue that I approached Sony for a refund as I bought the game on a digital download... Not only did they refuse to help with the situation, they pretty much didn't even see the connection between me buying the game from them and their level of responsibility with that.I spent a good 30 to 40 minutes arguing with the Sony Support reps and pretty much left with the resolution that they're never going to help me and I'm not going to buy another digital download from them!Sony Support angered me so much, I actually did sell the console about 6 weeks later and while this wasn't the only reason I sold it, it was a big reason why.Of course, on a side note, 2K finally reached out to me and told me they would give me all my VC back if I delete my player and start over. That stinks but, it is either that or lose the money and the fact that it took them 3 weeks to even acknowledge my request with no help from Sony at all leaves me questioning Sony's commitment to their customers and I will never buy another digital item from Sony and I'll be passing on Take Two games in the future.MISSING FEATURESFirst, I had no idea the console didn't support 3D Bluray when I bought it and I also had no idea that DLNA and even playback of movies or music from USB Media wasn't allowed either!Let me just say that both this and the Xbox One are incomplete consoles. However, this is a pretty complete list of things this console cannot do.*No YouTube uploading*No YouTube App #1 Video sharing service and no support at all.*No Google+ Support (this affects YouTube or it wouldn't really matter)*No Streaming or Playing of MP3 or MP4 files (not even from your PC or USB drive)*No Support for external hard drives at all at this point (most of the list comes from Sony)*No Sony Support for apps purchased from their digital store (so buy the hard copies)*No Ability to rename your online account (MS does this but, it will cost $20)*No Promoting a Child Account to an adult account, they get to start over*No Suspending or Resuming Games or Apps*No Support for 3D BluraySome of you might be okay without these features but, some will no doubt not like this at all.CONCLUSIONI'm torn between love and hate for this console and its creator. I really do love the console but, I really hate Sony right now and unfortunately, you cannot have one without the other.Overall, the lack of DLNA support, 3D Bluray, Removable Media Support, Poor Sony Support, Poor game library,  and a console that is even less complete than the Xbox One are all factors as to why I decided to sell the unit.Maybe some day I'll revisit this console again but, Sony has a real problem on their hands in my opinion because they have a console that lacks all the best features of their previous generation (and many of those from their competition).  I know most people say, that Sony is really focused on gamin and they had better be because the Console doesn't do very much else!What you really get here is a console that is focused on games and yet doesn't have a single game that would make you run out and buy it at the moment.  Sony is presently selling these units based on a spec sheet but, when people start to realize it isn't very fun, those numbers might just drop off pretty fast!I would say, pass on this console until they get more games out because, what they have now isn't worth it!",How do you like the design?,[],[],[],[],[]
electronics,heavy,lens,solid,lens,ba83a2b49053dc2805e3b85e6b759914,2,0.0,False,fac2e8bec06035a70307dd1e8034ea63,7e34a94e6f5329a62ace7f956e4c5303,B00006I53S,"I bought this lens for my Canon 20D digital camera and have found it to be a great all-purpose, everyday-use lens.  Here are the best features from my perspective:1.  The range of telephoto zoom is adequate for 90% of photo opportunites.  28-135 mm telephoto in digital photography translates into 48-230 mm in SLR film photography.  Since a standard camera lens is 50-55 mm, the starting range of this zoom lens equals that and then has the added versatility of zooming up to 135 mm (or 230mm in old style camera figures).  In my opinion, this added range of framing a shot gives the photographer so much more creativity, as well as being able to bring objects into closer, more intimate range.  I mentioned that this lens is good for 90% of all general camera shots; the missing 10% are those pictures that require a better zoom (more telephoto zoom), and those pics that need a wider field of view.  You may find that for group photos in close proximity, you want to take a step backwards to get everybody in the frame.  This is not a problem unless you simply don't have the room to take that step back.  I solved this problem by switching back to the original 18-55mm lens that came with the camera.  For the more distant shots that can't be drawn into the 135mm zoom of this lens I purchased a better telephoto zoom.2.  The lens has autofocus and IS stabilization technology.  For one used to manual focus lenses in SLR film photography, the addition of a fast autofocus lens is a terrific feature! I used to miss those spur of the moment shots because I was trying to achieve focus.  With this lens, you make those shots, because within a milisecond of depressing the shutter down halfway, the picture snaps into focus!  I absolutely love this feature!  The focuser has many points of potential focus, so it adapts easily to virtually all focusing situations.  For the really difficult focusing shots, there is the option of manual focusing.  While nice to have, I rarely use this option.  The Image Stabilization feature is a handy one in the longer shots.  ""IS"" lets one get away with a bit of camera shake without too much out-of-focus smear on the picture.  Canon does not recommend using the IS feature on tripod shots, so there is a switch to turn off the IS if desired.3.  The lens takes sharp clear pictures.  I have not been disappointed with the quality of the lens at all.Drawbacks1.  While there are not too many drawbacks to this lens, I think the major one is that the lens is bigger and heavier, in fact, much bigger and heavier than the standard 17-55 mm lenses that come with SLR cameras.  For me this is not a problem, however, for one that wants to have a lighter-weight camera, this could be considered a serious drawback.  On the other hand, a SLR camera like the Canon 20D or digital Rebel is not designed to be a smaller pocket-sized camera.  It is a larger format camera and of course the lenses will be larger (and heavier) as well.2.  Cost.  At just over 400 dollars, this lens is an investment.  Again, one has to weigh the obvious financial outlay, but the 28-135 mm lens is so superior to the cheaper 18-55 mm lens, that in my opinion, it is well worth the cost to upgrade.With this product, Canon made a great everyday camera lens.  From my perspective, the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages and I do recommend this lens to be your everyday standard camera lens.Jim ""Konedog"" Koenig",How do you like the lens?,['I do recommend this lens'],[3341],[2],[0.],[False]

You have to shoot in manual mode since there is no E-TTL available as far as I can tell. There is only one pin on the hot shoe plate so I'm pretty sure if it's attached to your camera it doesn't do TTL. I think there is something about TTL off camera in the manual that is written in Chinese first then English so it wasn't quite as clear as it could have been. It really isn't a bother to me since I do shoot in manual mode when I set up the portable studio and the home studio as well but that's a whole other story. If you're in need of a bright flash of light for your photography then this can do it for a little cheaper than a Canon or Nikon flash. It has a solid build and feel to it and seems like it will last a while even with some banging around. The only thing I didn't like was the fact that it is much longer than my Canon 430EXII and took up some real estate in the camera bag. I think it is comparable to the Canon 580EXII.

I am simply making a value judgement based on the price I paid -- about $35.00.I've had the pack for about two weeks now, and have loaded it up with a bunch of stuff, including two digital bodies, three zoom lenses, a Speedlite flash, a pocket tri-pod, a flash diffuser and an extra lense bag.  All of that is inside the main compartment. I am very pleased with how the main compartment can be sub-divided to fit just about any camera attachments you might have. Padding all around is quite adequate, although a bit more could be used at the top of the bag where the camera body and lense typically sit.The two zippered mesh compartments inside the main flap hold quite a bit of stuff, including the camera manual, flash manual, and various extra flash cards and batteries.The two velcroed pockets on either side of the bag are not designed to protect, but to hold stuff. That's fine with me, so I don't put anything in them that I mind getting wet or dusty.The main compartment flap has two zippered pockets on the outside. The bigger of the two pockets unzips on both sides and the top, and reveals two more small pockets and a small snap-hook. I use this pocket to store a photographic magazine or two I'm reading, cables, etc.The other zippered pocket on the main flap zips across the top and is wide and deep enough to hold quite a bit more stuff, stuff that is flat or can be flattened.The very outside of the main flap also has an open, expandable stretch-cord pocket that can be used to stuff in a light windbreaker.My impression is that this bag has so many pockets and compartments that you could overload it if you are not careful. Before using this bag, I had cameras and accessories in three different ""regular"" camera bags. Now it's all in one place, and I would not consider going back to a regular camera bag -- even if I do have to set the pack down before opening it up to retrieve cameras and accessories.Regarding quality of material and work, I am quite pleased. No frayed straps, no broken buckles, no weak seams, no shoddy workmanship.So the question is, for $35.00 did I get a good camera backpack? My answer without hesitation is, ""Yes."" Does this pack have the same quality and features of a $65.00 or $100.00 pack. No, of course not.BOTTOM LINEFor $35.00 my expectations were exceeded by this bag. At this price I see it as a real bargain.",Where can I get  extra space room for trucks?,[],[],[],[],[]

I simply couldn't set it up through chrome. I checked all the router settings as it was suggested by the installer, even reseted my router, but to no avail.

You can cast The Daily Show, or Colbert Report, but it only runs (almost) smoothly at 480p, and it takes a lot of CPU and RAM (you can hear the fan on Macbook Pro going crazy). The good thing though is that it also casts the audio to the tv. To be fair, this option is still in beta version, so hopefully it will get better with time.What is exciting about Chromecast is that Google recently released the SDK for developers, and they are doing a great job coming up with cool ideas (check out AllCast, for instance).

What was good is still good, when the connectivity is there.  When riding my motorcycle and the phone is mounted on my handlebars with nothing between me and the phone, connectivity is good and stays there.When I am doing yard work and the phone is on my right hip, connectivity is iffy.  And I get complaints of echoing and such intermittently.  I thought is was my phone because I had the Android 4.3 upgrade which trashed my wi-fi and I thought might have impacted my bluetooth as well but two weeks ago, I finally got a replacement phone.  The new Phone (Galaxy Note 2-Verizon) accepted the 4.3 and 4.4.2 updates with no issue to my wi-fi this time(YEA!) but the bluetooth issues are still there.  My son has the same headset with a galaxy S4 and the same problems.  My wife has the same headset on her Iphone-4 and no issues.  Go figure.So, my recommendation is this:1)  Buy it, try it out heavily and return it if it does not work.2)  If you have problems, Do not wait to return it or maybe get a fix from LG.  I waited too long and the warranty ran out.When it works, the sound is GREAT.  Good bass (well, let's just say my ears like it but I do have a bit of hearing loss so fidelity is no big deal for me).  Good volume.  Works great with my laptop and android tablet.The sad part is a cheap Bluetooth v2.1 works better with my phone than this one.I purchased this headset for one specific reason.  To be able to listen to music and communicate on the phone when riding my motorcycle.  I did not purchase through Amazon but a local big box store who did price match Amazon.I am going to look for a Bluetooth v4.0.  maybe that will work better.  Note, the v2.1 that work better fit me terribly.  I've got a big head and those did not have enough STRETCH to get around the back of my head.Setup Description:I have the LG730 paired with a Galaxy Note II phone (Verizon).  The phone does not have the stock battery, it has a 9300mah extended battery(warranty ZeroLemon Protection Guarantee CompatibleI mention this because it may be part of the problem I do occasionally have with the headset under the CON section.  I use the case provided by ZeroLemon for my phone.I mount my Galaxy Note 2 on my motorcycle (2007 Goldwing) using a RAM Mount for the phone (RAM Universal X Grip Tablet Tabletsand the handlebar (RAM Mounting RAM B 174 LO4U Reservoir Lowrance.  I bought the wrong phone mount initially but just flipped the prongs around to the smaller set on the back and it works great.  No fear of vibration.  I used it on a 1600 mile trip two weeks ago with no problems.I have a 3/4 Vega helmet with a face shield that I usually have lowered.  I also wear a heavy motorcycle jacket (not a leather jacket but a heavy duty nylon jacket with Kevlar protectors and such).  The LG730 sits inside the jacket and I zip the jack all the way up but leave the collar open to be able to get to the answer button.  The ear buds have no issues as long as I have them stretched out all the way.  I only wear one, not two when riding so check your state laws on that ([...]  I can turn my head left or right and not pull the bud out of my right ear.Usage Experience:PRO:Sound Quality:  Excellent compared to the helmet speakers I was using.  Good Bass and volume levels that are adjustable both on the phone and the headset so you can get the mix you want.  I am NOT an audiophile so I'm not concerned about the highest hi's or the lowest lows.  I just want to hear the music and hold a conversation.Microphone:  Very Good.  I made several test calls to multiple people while riding my motorcycle.  Up until about 40 MPH, they could not tell I was on a motorcycle.  Up to about 70MPH, all they heard was a bit of a buzz from my mufflers but could still hear me clearly and I could hear them quite well.Call notification:  Works well.  I can hear the phone ringing in my ear bud, the phone itself and vibration from the HB730.Call Answer:  Works well with bare fingers and light gloves.  Harder to get with thick gloves but doable (Auto answer would be nice).Wearing:  They are very flexible and comfortable to wear.CONS:When not on the motorcycle, I wear my phone on my right hip.  Sometimes the sound quality goes to pot listening to music while walking.  I""ll get skips in my songs.  This never happens on the same songs with my wired headset.  Turning off and back on the Tone+ usually clears that issue.  it's not an issue with the battery life (Usually high or on medium) and my phone with the 9300mah battery is NEVER low.  :)  (Love that battery....)I've noticed that when I lift up my left arm, i lose significant signal.  I've got a normal arm, no metals or anything in it but the blue tooth connections severely weakens and the sound almost drops out completely.  Drop my left arm back down, I'm good to go. (This may be related to my extended battery which completely covers the back of my Note 2 phone.  I'll find my original battery and see if I can duplicate the problem.No auto-answer.  Would be nice when working out or riding so I don't have to take a hand off of my handle bar.Hard to find the manual on the LG website.  An odd CON but I was just looking for it(to see if it can auto answer) and finding any support document for the LG Tone+ other than the sales page just wasn't there.Summary.Even with the small cons listed, this is a great Bluetooth headset for my purposes.  I also exercise at the gym with them.  I don't run (yet) but do walk on the treadmill and no problems to date with the slipping off.  Running might cause a problem because the are not tight around the back of my neck and may bounce.If it ever breaks, I'll buy it again.",How is it line ?,[],[],[],[],[]

Getting to the details on video I have to say that outdoors is where it shines. Indoor shots with normal lighting are also good but low light are viewable but somewhat grainy. Underwater video is equally good. You MUST turn that mode on. Each time the camera is turned off it resets and must be turned on again. It just compensates for the lighting underwater. I've forgotten to turn it on and the video looks good? The digital zoom is remarkably good. Usually digital zoom tends to be less than ideal but this camcorder handles it very well! Much better than expected. I don't hesitate to use it at all, even on full zoom it's good. The manual does not say what the zoom is nor does the camera. People here in the reviews have estimated and I'd GUESS 4-5x.As for the video modes 720p 30fps isn't bad. The picture is sharp and has great color. There can be some shakey almost slightly strobe light effect if you move the camera too fast. The built in image stabilization does help BUT you must turn it on. 720p 60fps is the bomb! I think this is the sweet spot and use this mode most of the time. 1080p 30fps is wonderful though you must again be careful with the camera movement. The image is just plain crisp!! Don't get me wrong this mode is great but it takes a lot of memory and isn't really practical for emailing or uploading to social networks. Looks beautiful on my 58 in. Samsung plasma.Stills as I said are good and a couple outdoor shots I took rival my better camera. Parties, walks on the beach, hanging with friends are good venues for the stills. Important parties, weddings, those moments that really mean something, no, use a dedicated real camera.Battery life is pretty decent. I shoot 30 sec. to 1 min. most of the time then power off and it has lasted through 2 serious parties 40-50 vids at each party with time to spare. Not sure if you just turned it on and let it go for like 5-10 min. vids? My guess is that it wouldn't last as long. That's the WORST way to take vids anyway!! Nothing is worse than a 5 minute or longer video to watch!! OMG, please don't ever force a vid of that length on a friend. Because you can't say anything and have to sit through the whole horrid thing. Show the same vid in 1 min or less clips and it's acceptable. Just my opinion.This has been a great purchase for me. As said the waterproof capability is what sold me. If you don't want to lug the camcorder and camera along this just pops in the pocket. It's inexpensive and FUN, buy it you won't regret itP.S. I think it's as nice or nicer than the Flip. Comparing it to my friends Flip, the vids are the same but this is WATERPROOF!",Do you know film a video?,['digital' 'WATERPROOF'],[ 992 3200],[1 1],[0. 0.],[False False]

For the most part the router served me well enough to not want to replace it.  There were occasional instances in which the router would drop the connection during internet surfing or more importantly online game play, but I chalked it up as having to do with my ISP instead of my equipment.  Also sometimes this router would get in a funky state and i would be unable to connect to my DSL modem but that was resolved by unplugging it for about 30 seconds and turning it back on.  These issues were annoying but minor and infrequent occurrences.  I have tried other routers such as D-link and Netgear, but I did not like the interface enough to replace my trusty old Linksys.  I recently got the opportunity to get a new router from a company I never heard of before, TP-Link and I figured why not?Off the bat, I would like to say I do like the updated look of this router.  The glossy black finish and the large indicator lights on the front is a big upgrade in look from my 10 year old Linksys router.Looks aside, when I first got this router, honestly, I wasn't too confident that would would be as good as my Linksys, but I decided to give it a chance and if all else failed I could always go back to the Linksys.  However after using it for about a month I am very impressed with my new router and its features that are not present on my Linksys.  Since using this router I have not experienced any disconnections during online game play and while I won't say its ""faster"", my online games seem to play much smoother than before.I did really want to setup the TP-Link using the CD because of past experiences with using included CD's to set hardware up, but in hindsight the CD Setup was great and did not cause much issue at all.  After setting up the router using the CD and trying to connect to the internet for the first time, my ISP directed me to their page to setup a new username and password to use with the router.  I thought this for sure would cause an issue, but it didn't which was a relief.  To make things even better after the setup process was complete the router created a .txt document that listed all my settings, username/password and network keys for future use.Another thing I like about the TP-Link router is that the interface is just as if not more intuitive and user friendly as my Linksys was.  One of the things I disliked about the Netgear and D-link routers was that the interface was terrible making simple things hard to find and simple tasks harder to do than it should have been.  With the TP-Link router interface, every menu is easy to find and its functions are clearly explained.A couple of features I like about the TP-Link are the Dual band capability and the USB port on the back of the router which allows you to connect a USB device such as a printer or a External Hard drive for all computers on the network to share.  Neither of these features were present on my Linksys.I originally wasn't going to use the Dual Band setup but since it was so easy to set up and configure I figured it couldn't hurt to try it out.  I have my laptop, cell phone, and my son's 3DS connected to the 2.4GHZ network, while I have my XBOX and PS3 connected to the 5GHz network.  Since using this new configuration I haven't had any disconnections on my XBOX or PS3 while playing them online.  As I said before when disconnections occurred in the past I thought it was my ISP, but now I haven't had any disconnections since, maybe it WAS my old router that was the culprit.The feature I really like is the shared USB feature.  There is a USB port on the back of the router that you can connect a USB device to that can be shared across your network.  Since my printer was already shared over my network, I decided to use this port to connect my external hard drive so I could perform my system backups more easily.  Prior to this setup, I was using Buffalo Link stations and Drive stations for my backups which didn't always work properly (especially with the LinkStation) so I ended up slacking off on backing up because it became too much trouble.  However now with the USB share feature backups are as easy as connecting the USB drive to the router and mapping a network drive on each computer to that device.  Backups for me are extremely easy and I can do them every night without any issue.  I have noticed that the transfer speed during my backups seems to be slower than they were with my Linkstation, however since my backups are usually done at night when no one is on the computer this doesn't bother me too much.In conclusion, since using this new router I don't even know its there which is a good thing.  The transition from using my Linksys router to the TP-Link was smooth and mostly painless. One star deduction for the slow transfer speeds, but other than that no big issues. I still have my Linksys in case things change, but I am hoping that the TP-Link gives me many years of service as my old router did.",What is the light device?,[],[],[],[],[]

Here's why.The Picture:The picture was gorgeous, right out of the box. We had no need to tweak the default settings. The quality of the picture is truly astonishing.We may be part of that fringe group of viewers who love the SOE, ""soap opera effect."" We like our TV picture to be as lifelike and ""live"" as possible, so to watch a movie that appears like live TV is a treat. We see no reason to degrade the image so it looks like a movie. If my wife is watching TV I have to ask her if it is a movie or live because I can't tell by just looking at the screen.  Maybe SOE should be renamed LTVE, Live TV Effect. Love that LTVE effect!3D:The 3D is excellent. 3D really does add to the enjoyment of, well, anything. If you are wondering if 3D is worth the additional cost, the answer is YES. Provided you have a source for 3D programming.3D Glasses:The four included 3D glasses are well made. They are a different shape from the usual 3D glasses, which makes them more comfortable for prolong use, even over the eyeglasses which we both wear.The Remote:The remote is a good size, well-balanced with buttons intelligently sized and placed. For example, the mute button is just above the volume control buttons. The buttons are backlit for five seconds when a light button is pressed.The controls are easy and natural. The set is well designed ergonomically.One major annoyance in the Vizio TV was that you had to manually tell the TV that the image was in 3D, then tell it which type of 3D, then say yes, you really do want to view it in 3D before it would present the image in 3D. This Panasonic is smart enough to figure out the type of image, 3D or 2D, and then present it in that format without user intervention. The process is automatic. In both directions.Also, this TV does not get confused and freeze up when I am quick on the remote buttons as the Vizio did.Wi-Fi:I can't comment on the Wi-Fi since I don't use it on the TV, other than to say it successfully found my Wi-Fi channel and gave me access. I may use it in the future.Speakers:The speakers are adequate for us, providing clear speech and decent music. The TV is in a bedroom and sounds fine in that room. If you want movie theater sound you probably need an external speaker system.One negative is that the TV does not have an output jack for analog audio, such as a headphone. Only a digital audio jack.The manual:Panasonic does provide a printed (gasp) manual to use in assembling the base and setting up your TV. Detailed drawings of various possible connections are included. The TV is super easy to setup, essentially plugging it in and connecting to your TV source. That's it. The default picture needs no adjusting, but adjustments are available in you want to play around.  A 199 page manual is available online.  But you don't really need it.It was work to repack and return the Vizio TV using Amazon's free 30 day trial period (although Amazon was great, as usual, and credited us the full purchase price on the very next day after they received the return), but it did let us see how much better this Panasonic is and appreciate it so much more. I am actually grateful that we had problems with the Vizio else we might never have discovered this Panasonic.Packaging:The TV arrived in perfect condition, expertly packed with heavy tape holding the base safely away from the TV.Delivery:Amazon used Ceva for the delivery. Ceva lets you give them a time window for the delivery. We selected the 9:00 AM to noon window so we would be dressed and finished with breakfast before their arrival. However, they rang our doorbell at 8:00 AM, just as we sat down to breakfast. Inconvenient.The box was in perfect condition with no gouges or punctures.Repacking the TV in the box in the future if we need to will be a chore. I snapped several pictures as we unpacked the box so we can reverse the process if we ever need to. I saved printed copies of the pictures inside the box which we stored away.In conclusion:We have enjoyed this TV since July 16th. We like everything about it and obviously intend to keep it at the end of our 30 day trial. If anything happens that changes our minds, I will post an update. I will also post an update if I discover anything else that you should know about.",How is that effect so good?,['truly astonishing'],[244],[2],[1.],[ True]

The on/off button is quite easy to press and easily pressed if it is stuffed into a bag. The flashlight in the external battery is a big plus. It is a bright LED light that works well if the power is out or looking for something in the night. The light is easily turned on because of the easily pressed on/off buttons. The flashlight is activated by pressing 2 times fast on the on/off button. This battery has 2 USB ports. One is 5 volts at 2 amps and the other is 5 volts at 1 amp. There are 4 LED's that tell how much power the battery pack has left for charging other devices. The battery has a smooth, shiny, reflective and stylish finish which looks awesome. The finish on the battery also attractions a lot of fingerprints which could make the battery look bad if not cleaned every so often.This battery has a massive 15000mah lithium ion battery in it that is packed in a small casing. This battery is smaller than most other external batteries I have researched in the past which is ideal for packing in a small bag. I use this battery to charge my iPhone 5 and my iPod touch 5. I can charge both these devices simultaneously.This product is ideal for someone who travels a lot and uses a smartphone for their business when traveling. This battery is also good for people who go camping and are not around power that watch movies and play games on their device for long periods of time. Other than the buttons being easily pressed this is the perfect external battery for those looking into buying one to use for a long trip or power your friends device and keep your devices charged in case of a black out.The Anker Astro E5 is closely comparable to the Astro E4.Anker Astro E4 13000mAh External Battery Pack Portable Power Bank Charger for iPhone 5, 4S, 4, iPad 4, 3, 2, Mini, iPods; Samsung Galaxy S4, S3, S2, Note 2; HTC One, EVO, Thunderbolt, Incredible, Droid DNA; Motorola ATRIX, Droid; Google Nexus 4, Nexus 7... (This has a 13000mah lithium ion battery) Both of these batteries look identical from the looks to the locations of the ports but the Astro E5 has a 15000mah battery that puts it over the top of the Astro E4.Overall the Anker Astro E5 is a great external battery that can charge your smartphone to 100% and do it again 6-8 more times and has a modern look most smartphones have today. You won't have to worry about your phone dying for more than a week when using this external battery.So far i have charged my iPhone 5 twice and it still has 4 LEDS.Another Update: i have charged my ipod touch 2 times and my iPhone 5 3 times and it now has 1 LED and can still charge my devices.I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation, and I promised that my review is fair and honest.",How is the battery?,['great external battery'],[24],[2],[0.425],[False]

The size of keys are good but for my liking, they could be a little smaller but with the same spacing so there is a little more room between each key - this helps with the speed of my typing as I tend to trip over neighboring keys.  The action is pretty good for an inexpensive keyboard but still cannot compare with the Zagg which I think has the best action in the business.  Still, the issues I have had with other cheap keyboards did not appear with the NT38B - things such as stuck keys or repeating keyssssssss, etc.  There does seem to be a slight lag at times but I am a fast typist.  Still, not an issue with the Logitech or the ZaggThis next item is picayune but I miss the lit keyboard I have with my Zagg.

I have had three keyboards.  First was the Apple keyboard and as great as it is, it definitely is not easily transportable.  Best kept in a stationary location.  I also have a recently purchased keyboard that folds up.  Meets the test of transportability, but quite frankly doesn't feel comfortable and has certain awkward key locations.  The other keyboard I purchased was for my original IPad and it attached to make a nice package to carry around.  However, the weak part for me was that the keyboard never felt comfortable, Keys were cramped.  Not that easy to type on.  I found the ad for this product and couldn't resist the purchase.  Turns out to be a hands down winner.  Looks and feels as a keyboard  should. Very solid feel to it.  Came neatly packaged in a neoprene carry pouch with a charging cable, albeit a bit short in length.  Was very easy to link via Bluetooth to my iPad and manages to stay linked each time I begin to use it.  The keyboard layout was perfect.  The keys really look and act as keyboard keys should.  Far superior for me than most of the other keyboards I have used.  Have not had the keyboard long enough to comment on battery life, but charging is rather simple, so not an issue.  Lastly, really meets the test of transportability as it easily attaches to my new iPad.  Attaching the keyboard to the iPad when carrying it is a cinch as is removing it for use.  The neoprene carrypouch fits the ipad and keyboard thus acting as a protective cover when carrying it around.  There are many ways to set it up.  I will leave that up to you to find the one that works best for you.  I had great fun typing this review using features to cut, paste, etc.If you have need for a really neat and efficient keyboard that is both useful when left in a stationary location or easily transportable as a single unit with your iPad then this is the one for you.  I would stronly recommend you buy this one.  You won't be disappointed.",How was the key?,[],[],[],[],[]

I was really just looking for some cheaper noise cancelling headphones to wear at work. I use studio headphones and have in my home studio arsenal cans by Shure, Sony, and Beyerdynamic. These Sennheiser HD202's are simply amazing not just for the price point but for the comfort and function. The sound quality is absolutely stellar, even when listening to a 48khz AAC+ web radio stream. And now that I have these, I've noticed them being used in radio studios and being included in condenser microphone package deals. I also like the belt-clipping cable spool that comes with it so you can wind up the non-coiled cord neatly.Haven't used these for studio work as of yet but they do sound comparable to my $200 Beyerdynamic 770's and sound much better than my Sony MD7506 cans.",What do you think about the sound quality?,[],[],[],[],[]
