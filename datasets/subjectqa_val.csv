I wanted something a little smaller that still had a front pocket for extras such as an iPod, the laptop power cord, a small external hard drive, and a couple cables. This case was in my price range and is well reviewed. The very first review and a few others I read mentioned that this bag was a little small and potentially a tight fit. I have a Lenovo e420 14"" laptop and decided to buy the 16"" bag so I would have a little extra room.When the case arrived the first thing I noticed is the bag is very slim. My 14"" Lenovo e420 fits comfortably in the bag leaving a little extra room so it does not scrape the zipper. If I had gone with the 14"" bag I have no doubts that there would have been issues with the laptop rubbing on the zipper. I have enough extra room to put a manila folder with some paperwork in the pocket along with the laptop itself. The second/middle zipper has several pockets inside that are good for storing small things. In my case, some SD cards and thumb drives. In front of those small pockets there is room for the laptop power cord, a small usb external hard drive, my iPod Classic, and a couple small misc cables. With all those items it makes the pocket a little bulgy and doesn't leave much room for anything else. The very front zippered pocket on the bag is really tiny. I have a cellphone charger in it and that is a very snug fit by itself.Honestly had I known the bag was practically a notebook sleeve with a front pocket I probably would've opted for a different bag. That being said I'm going to use this one for awhile and see if it grows on me. I like that the bag is smaller than my old one and that its very lightweight material.

I don't really mind the corners being exposed much since one corner houses the speakers and another corner is the sleep/lock button.

I, so far, have been proven wrong about that. The picture is excellent any way you look at it.Now, I'm not a big gamer. I'm too old for that (although I do own both an Xbox with Kinect and a Wii). So I can't verify the issues other reviewers stated about the slower refresh rate causing their video to lag while playing. As of yet, I saw no lag in anything I viewed to date. I truly believe that unless you are going to be one of those ultimately picky people that I have come across in other reviews, whether you choose to purchase this TV with the 120 hz rate of the 240, I feel you will enjoy the picture either way.One comparison I have between my Samsung 47"" and the LG 55"" is that it seems with all the reviews of these TV's, people are complaining about the light LED bleeding especially from the corners. I saw that very sugnificantly with the Samsung. But, I have to say with my experience of owning this TV in the last week, there is no such bleeding to speak of. The upper left corner seems to display a slightly lighter glow than the other three but nothing to really be annoyed about. After watching the movie ""Cowboys + Aliens"" last night, I was awe struck by the clarity of the picture and the true to life colors. No, it wasn't a blu ray copy, just the standard DVD copy and it was still awesome. I felt as if I could walk right into the screen and be part of the movie. With my theatre sound and that picture, I felt as if I was back at the theatre watching it for a second time. Oh, and it was also not in 3D mode either.I am not sure I am all that big on the local dimming option either because I was a little annoyed that when the scene went dark, and I had the room dark with just the christmas tree lights on, the picture would darken. Then when some sort of lighting would appear on screen, the picture would lighten back up to normal. I thought this was odd as to me, shouldn't the picture, in a brighter setting then become dim instead of brighter? I don't know maybe I was seeing it incorrectly, not sure.As other reviewers have commented about the 3D for this television, in a way I do find it kind of gimmicky, (if that is a word). But, that too, is still a very awesome feature for home theatre. By gimmicky, I found that while using the 3D mode during regular television viewing, if the frame of actors was still with not much movement, then the picture appeared 2D. But once the scene got more active and there was more background motion, then one can very much so see the depth of 3D. I also noticed that when viewing a program in true HD, if in 3D mode, the sharper the picture, the more the 3D depth stands out. Now, movies and videos that are shot in 3D are awesome! I have TRON Legacy in 3D. With the purchase of this TV I also purchased an LG 3D blu ray player. It was so awesome being able to view that movie feeling as if I was at the theatre watching it for the second time in 3D. It is so cool also, with the passive 3D, one can view movies and shows in 3D without worrying about a second box or if the batteries are going to die. You just put the glasses on when switched to 3D mode and totally enjoy!The LG apps are ok. There could be more. One reviewer totally put down the Netflix app. I found nothing wrong with it. It loaded my shows just fine and I actually watched and episode of ""The Munsters"" in 3D. Very cool. I dowloaded the 3D Zone app. It's a cool app if you want something to give you the feel of what your 3D watching experience should be like. The videos are streamed over the internet connection and since my wireless seems a bit hoaky at times where it is located, I had to wait for each 30 second set of video to keep downloading. I also didn't like the way the producers of these 3D vidoes felt it necessary to combine the logos for the videos with actual moving background videos. The whole experience was very annoying for me to watch with all that misplaced movement going on. Once you get passed the logos and the actual video begins to play, then it's pretty cool to watch in 3D.My whole experience with the product at this point is in one word ""Awesome""! Unless some failure happens with it or I notice other anomolies, I would definitely recommend this product to others. It's a very fun and enjoyable home theatre experience. Reviewers are mentioning how the TV cuts the resolution in half for each eye so you still get the 1080P HD picture. Well all that is way too techincal for this reviewer to worry about. All I know, from my experience the last few days, this product, whether in 3D or not, gives a very sharp, clear, wathable picture. It has a whole suite of picture setting options, some even I don't understand what they do.Oh, and I also find the magic remote quite useful. I prefer using it with the pointer on the screen as a ""one click and point"" button solution over trying to go through the menu options and trying to find all the right keys on the regular remote, especially if you can't see them in the dark. It's so much easier to use than the standard remote control. So, for me, the magic remote is a huge plus!The only drawback I found annoying, as others have mentioned, the speakers for these thin tv's have a bit to be desired. But what can one expect. I felt that once you adjust all the sound options, you can get some pretty good sound out of the built in speakers so again that function isn't even too bad. But, I want to be able to add my first sub-woofer for added bass during regular TV viewing, without having to run it through the stereo reciever where a second sub-woofer is already connected. The only option I could find on the back for an external audio out connection was the headphone jack. I tried plugging my sub-woofer into that jack but because it is labeled as a headphone jack, the tv ""smartly"" disables the on-board speakers and doesn't offer the user the option to do so his or herself. The TV warns you that you have plugged something into the headphone jack and the the speakers turn off. Then I can get some bass through my sub-woofer but now without any sound from the TV. Hmmmmm.... The Samsung at least had not a headphone jack but a labeled audio out jack and didn't disable the internal speakers unless you opted to do so through the options screen. So, now I have to research another way to get sound to my first sub-woofer without the need to turn go through my stereo receiver first.I also noticed people were complaining about the digital fibre optic output and that it didn't pass through the 5.1 audio. I haven't hooked anything up to that yet so I am not going to review or comment further unless I do.All In all, I think the TV so far is awesome and I do say go out and order it or buy it if you have the cash!!!!Update, 1.5 months after purchase....I still go with all the above except now I have tried the 5.1 optical output. I tried playing some dvd video files with 5.1 surroumd sound still encoded and the sound was produced just as it was with the original movies through all 5 speakers. I found that to be awesome!I also don't see where people FREAK out about the saying the resolution is being cut in half when viewing 3D. What exactly do you people feel your eyes are actually capable of detecting when watching television? Geez!! I felt when veiwing 3D, the picture looks every bit as sharp and clear as it did when viewing 2D. Maybe I'm not as picky as some of you but when you expect something more than your own eyes are able to detect in the first place, that is going too far in my book! Just watch it and enjoy!I personally love this television and I personally NOT going to wait a year for some other technology to come out. As far as I am concerned, the next technology will have to be when they make the images holographic and appear in the middle of my living room or viewing area without using any glasses or wearing anything extra for veiwing what-so-ever. Until they master that feet, I'm pretty satisfied with what I have now. Just hope it doesn't blow up on me in the next 5 years or so! :-)",What is the picture like?,['The picture is excellent'],[300],[1],[1.],[ True]

""You need this"" the big box salesman would say and then hand you a $30 or $40 package with a 3 or 6 foot HDMI cable - usually of dubious quality.  Many still do this, and some of the bigger high-discount box stores still have amazingly high prices on ""accessories"" for any audio or video equipment.Savvy consumers quickly learned that they could get a perfectly good HDMI cable for single digits, and an online cable business in the Los Angeles area has made a big business about selling excellent quality cables for small markups.Meanwhile, Amazon has also been a great source for third party companies selling good cables at steep discounts.  At the same time, Amazon has become involved in providing video content, so it makes sense for them to also provide their own products for watching those videos (assuming that your 7"" Kindle Fire screen is too small, lol).Just looking at these cables shows that Amazon is quite serious about the video business.  The smooth black plastic with the Amazon name/logo is covered with cellophane to keep it looking good for when you are ready to install the cable.  The plugs are relatively slim, so that they fit in situations where there are plugs above and below the HDMI jack.The Amazon Basics name on the cable itself, shows that even the raw cable supplier is making significant quantities specifically made for this product.Unfotunately, I cannot yet test the ethernet or other advanced capabilities of the cable, but it is certainly nice to know that it won't be necessary to buy a new cable later if I do upgrade.The cable clearly has tough and solid construction, without being overly thick and awkward to work with.I did try replacing the HDMI cable to my main living room 1080p screen with this cable and could not detect any difference.  Since the 3 year old cable was a top premium HDMI cable of its day, that is a very good recommendation for this product.Of course, the biggest selling point is the very inexpensive selling price of this cable.  Since it qualifies for Amazon's usual free shipping when included with other items to make up the minimum, it's hard to find any other HDMI cable of equal quality at this price.",How is the deal?,[],[],[],[],[]

I got a replacement which fixed one problem but introduces another.  I'll insert comments into my original review.----I agree with almost everything said in the other positive reviews about the great ergonomics, the scroll wheel that you can toggle between hyperscrolling (very useful) and the more common measured/notched scrolling, the many useful features attached to the other buttons, the way you can use the mouse while the battery recharges, and the incredibly tiny receiver that works with other compatible devices.Maybe you're having trouble thinking of a way to justify spending $100 for a rodent.  I was too, but I thought of a way to justify it that maybe a few of you might find helpful:Before now, I'd never spent more than $30 on a mouse (except once, a $50 microsoft bluetooth mouse that doesn't work too well).  But I was never happy with any of them.  They were either uncomfortable after an hour or so of use, or stopped working after a while, or something.  So, after a few months, I'd give up and buy another one.  Over time, I spent probably $200 on a series of cheap mice.When the Performance MX came out a few weeks ago, I saw all the positive reviews (from users and from professional publications and websites), and it occurred to me that maybe if I spent more for a really good mouse, I'd be happy and wouldn't have to keep buying $30 mice every few months.As I said above, in most ways I think this is a great mouse and agree with the many other positive reviews.  But I've experienced some minor issues, too.1.  When you start pushing the mouse around after it's been sitting idle - even for just a few minutes - there's an annoying one- to two-second lag before the cursor reacts.  UPDATE Sept 15:  Logitech tech support figured out that this was a defect.  I got a replacement, and it's perfect.  With Amazon, I didn't have to pay shipping for the replacement, and I didn't have to return the first mouse until after receiving the replacement.  Very happy with Amazon's service.2.  At this time, the number of devices that are compatible with the unifying receiver is very small:  just two keyboards and three mice.  The unifying receiver would be far more valuable if there were more different types of compatible devices.  For example, I would like to see a numeric keypad and also a presentation/pointer that could work with the unifying receiver - logitech makes both such devices now, but they won't work with the unifying receiver.3.  I'm probably being too picky here, but I find the ""click"" to be a bit tinny, and louder and less satisfying than other mice I've used.  UPDATE Sept 15:  the replacement mouse is worse.  The left button makes the same tinny click when you press down, but when you let go it makes a louder sound, almost like a knock on a door.  (The right mouse button doesn't do this.  Go figure.)  This gets annoying after a while.  Sorry, but if I'm paying $100 for a mouse, I want it to be just about perfect.Since almost all the other reviews of this mouse are very positive, I am sure that my experience with two of them each having a minor but annoying defect is uncommon.  In absence of these apparently rare defects, this is a really great mouse.",How is the connection?,[],[],[],[],[]

It's quite a stunning thing to see photos with this lens shot with a little XSi. Once you have enough skill to get your modes set right you can be shooting portraits, animals, flowers, product shots (I do a lot of that) and a ton of other great stuff with this bit of glass.If your shooting a crop body like I do, you'll need a wide angle lens for those landscape and indoor shots where this thing doesn't get wide enough. I use a Sigma 20mm f/1.8 for those times. It's a great standard lens for crop bodies, the sharpness and depth of field effects you can get from opening up that big 1.8 aperture are stunning.But this Tamron zoom is no slouch either when it comes to bokeh and sharpness. Stop it down to 4 or so and in decent light it will give you excellent sharpness, contrast and color. I find I seldom reach for the 20mm except when I want to get right up next to a flower or insect or maybe a piece of jewelry in a product photo, open the aperture and get really smeared backgrounds.You can do that with the Tamron. But the Sigma seems to produce the better backgrounds in those situations. You just have to get real close and personal with the camera.Last fall we were camping at a local reservoir in central PA during the height of the fall colors when I found a huge spider in a fully formed, quite beautiful web. It had recently rained and the web had a lot of those nice dewy droplets on its filaments. I was able, with this Tamron, to get very close to spidey and web, choke off a lot of depth of field and soften the water and multicolored trees in the background to a beautiful palette of color with only hints of shape. That was one of the best series of shots I've ever taken, and it was with this lens. Stopped down a bit to give more form to the background and spidey was in a whole new light.This lens works for weddings and birthdays, school plays, picnics, tourism, whatever.If you need more zoom than this, maybe you should buy a telescope. I can see needing a wider lens than this, but if you can't zoom close enough, shoot RAW and enlarge. This zoom range is perfect for 90% of my image composition within the range it shoots.It's much easier to compose than with my 20mm Sigma prime. Any prime lens will have you walking around, backing up, moving in, trying to get that frame right. The payoff is unbeatable sharpness and speed per dollar.However, this 2.8 zoom lens is plenty fast, and very sharp as well.I bought this lens a couple years ago for under $400. The Sigma prime cost more than that, and I only use it for about ten percent of my shots.This thing is so far beyond the price in terms of capability, that I will buy another one if this one ever breaks.Recommended.",How is the build quality like?,['backgrounds'],[47],[1],[0.],[False]

I also wanted to try writing versus typing on my computer. I have software that supports tablet devices, so when I found a Bamboo at a reasonable price I decided to give it a try. It proved to be a good purchase for a couple of reasons, none of which have to do with my [in]ability to draw.The device is small, just a little bigger than a mouse pad. The writing area is even smaller, being about the size of a standard index card. I wasn't sure how I would manage this area in which to work at first, but I knew the dimensions when I bought it, so no complaints.Installation was easy. I plugged it into the USB port, installed the drivers and was up and running in minutes. There were no snags in the process and no surprises.I immediately was able to start working with the tablet and found it to be an excellent substitute for a mouse, once I got used to it. The biggest hurdle was discovering that tablets do not scroll like mice - picking up the pen and moving it to a new place on the writing surface makes the pen jump on the screen. Lower left corner on the tablet = lower left corner on the screen and so on. There are very distinct advantages and disadvantages to this. On one hand, it makes pinpointing on the screen very easy and straightforward, but on the other it takes some time to adjust from relative positioning to absolute.I fired up my drawing software and experimented. Just like a real pen, the pressure on the pad can be varied to make lines drawn on the canvas stonger or softer and I was able to draw very heavy lines and very faint lines. There are 512 pressure levels, which is sufficient for the casual user like me, but more serious artists may require more fine control over the pressure.I was unsuccessful in my efforts to use it as a writing tool. It is not that it doesn't work, it is more a function of impatience on my part. I found that I could not make the adjustment to writing on an abstract surface and have it look right. Usually, the software translated my writing into the wrong thing and I would have to go back and type. I did not try very long so I didn't give this much of a chance.One thing that tripped me up was the ""flicking"" motion that could be used for scrolling once the drivers were installed. I got used to it and came to appreciate it, but at first it was frustrating because I would inadvertently flick and the canvas area would scroll.I did find that using this device has limited use when gaming. For games like chess and sudoku, it is far and away better than a regular mouse. For 3D shooters or something akin to tetris, this is absolutely the wrong device for controlling the pointer.The biggest benefit for me was in using it as a general pointing device. Holding the pen is easier on my hands than messing with a mouse, which resulted in a lot less cramping when working. I have tried trackballs, cordless mice and even the touchpad on my laptop, and none are as comfortable as the pen.I did not keep my Bamboo Small, I passed it on to my niece who is very artistic. I gave it up because, to be honest, I wanted a larger tablet. I replaced it with an Intuos4 Medium which better fits my hands.The Bamboo Small tablet and pen is an excellent entry point in the tablet market for anyone wanting to learn about tablets and how they can work out. My experience with this device was excellent and I can recommend it for its ease of setup , simple use, and in my case comfort. As I said above, the main reason I parted with mine was to get a larger tablet, but for people with smaller hands or limited budgets this is a wonderful tablet with which to start.",How can I know if this area is dance?,[],[],[],[],[]

It is designed for people who want to use their iPad Mini in some very rough and physically demanding environments. It is also a stylish case that will not be out of place in your hip neighborhood coffee shop.One of the first things you notice about this case is that it's pretty heavy, much more so than some other such case/keyboard that are on the market right now. If you are looking for a very light accessory for your iPad Mini then this case is not for you. The case is also pretty hard to open up and insert your iPad Mini into. You need to pull back the rubberized outer cover, and then carefully pry open several small plastic hinges. You will probably not want to take your iPad Mini in and out too often.The case is indeed very sturdy and it covers your iPad Mini almost completely, including the plastic screen cover. It imbues one with a confidence that the case will protect your iPad Mini from most falls and bumps, although I have not been brave enough to venture an actual physical test. The case detaches from the keyboard, and it allows you to use the iPad by itself. All ports are covered with rubberized plugs, but they are easily pulled back and allow the ports to be easily accessed with chords.The keyboard paired up with my iPad Mini very easily and without any hitches. It also maintained connection for the duration of use.  The keyboard is charged through a micro USB slot on the side. (An Apple compatible charging port might have been a more appropriate choice, but knowing how reluctant Apple is to let the third-party vendors use its ports, this was likely not going to happen.) The keyboard is very responsive, and I for the most part like the key action. However, this sized keyboard is VERY cramped, and you really don't want to be using it for composing longer documents.The arm that attaches the case to the keyboard allows for your iPad to rotate through an arbitrary angle. However, only the portrait and the landscape orientations will be useful for the most part. I found the landscape orientation to be unstable though - I either had to allow the iPad Mini to ""dangle"" above the keyboard, or pull it out so far that the connecting arm becomes detached. If you are planning on typing in an on-the-go situation far away from a desk, then all of this is less than optimal.The case/keyboard combo is very well made. It is also competitively priced, and if you are looking for a rugged device/accessory of this kind then you will not go wrong with this New Trent model.

Its very responsive to the touch seems very fast for what I need it for and the weight is great.  I had the Kindle Fire and I enjoyed it but I do like having access to the Google Market and figured if I need to read books I can always use the Kindle app for android which works very well. I will say the first samsung tablet I picked up I found a few ""lit"" pixels which showed up when using a black background. I took it back to the store and repurchased another one and so far I do not see the same issue.I think the camera even though its getting a bad reputation still is nice since the Fire does not even have one.  I don't see myself out taking snapshots with this thing but sometimes its nice having it and I might try Skype on it at some point.  So far the wifi has worked great, I downloaded about 800mb of music over iSyncr Wifi the other nite along with downloading apps from the google market and did not notice hardly any slow down.  I think for the money this is gonna be a great tablet.  I currently have an ipad 1st gen, Touchpad rooted with Android and a KFire.

However, at this price, ""I like it"" a lot. If it is durable it may earn my ""I love it"" -- especially since I will probably use it pretty hard (8-12 hours a day, in and out of a laptop bag nearly every work day), and since it is a $15 mouse I won't be all that careful about it.It is my main mouse for a desktop replacement laptop, both travel with me to work most days. So, I will see how it holds up and update if it wares out or develops problems - if I don't update that means that it is still going strong and I still stand by this review. If it lasts into the 5 year range I will update and probably change it to 5 stars.Next the review points:Pros:To start, I like this mouse. It feels good in my medium-large man hands. The grip on the thumb side feels good; although, I had to push mine into place as it was peeling on arrival and it continues to be somewhat loose or prone to getting pulled out of place, it sits to high above the surrounding plastic [Edit, this continues to be ""loose""]. (I do wish there was a thin strip on the pinky side.)The adjustable DPI will probably be nice for some light game play and some situations, but I generally just keep it on the lowest setting. But having the option is a bonus.The mouse is nice and responsive and I have not noticed any lags (I'm using it on an Ivy Bridge I5 3230m in a Toshiba Satellite L series, Windoze 8 and will be dual booting Kubuntu, when I get a chance to set it up; if I don't update the mouse works fine as a native in Ubuntu as I expect it will [edit, confirmed, works in every distro I've played around with lately (all Debian/Ubuntu forks)]).The back and forward rocker works great and is also very nice to have.The mouse moves smoothly and works on every reasonable surface I've tried it on, including the number pad on the side of my laptop keyboard, which is nice.Range is good, as advertised about 15 feet through walls, etc and about 25 feet in the perfect situation (in the same room or outside).Cons:I wish it had a real off switch since it wakes the Laptop up on button click, until the mouse shuts itself off; you have to take the dongle out when you are transporting the laptop or shut off the wake up settings.This boarders on nitpicking and is related to the previous point: I wish it had a clip like some Logitech mice do so that it clips to the back of my screen and when clipped it shuts off the mouse so that it doesn't wake up the pc -- [edit, I really, really wish that it had such a clip]. This is a good thing because it protects the mouse by ensuing that it is in the padded case with the laptop, rather than just thrown into the bag or outside pocket to get banged, bumped, and (maybe) broken. I really don't understand why anyone would manufacture a wireless mouse without this feature. It just makes good business sense and is relatively cheap.Finally, the mouse does feel a bit less high end. As I mentioned the grip pad for the thumb was out when I took it out of the box, but other things don't quite fit right. One corner of the battery cover sticks out and is a bit stiff to remove (feels like you might break it), but hopefully I'll only replace the battery ever year or so.Overall the mouse feels just solidish. As in, somehow I suspect it isn't as durable is my partners beat up 3-4 year old Logitech that is still going strong. But only time will tell and that Logitech was almost twice the price.Nit-picking (in order of importance):The scrolling wheel is a little high and I wish it was closer to the tip of my middle finger.This boarders on obnoxious nitpicking, but the material you touch is that slick glossy plastic and I wish it had a bit of texture.The slick material feels, sweaty or something, I don't know, I don't like touching it as much as other mouse textures -- yeah, it is nitpicky, I know.At this point I strongly recommend this product. I like it a lot right now for its price, but if it proves durable that may make me love it (as in 5 stars).If you are a cheap-skate like me and looking for a good mouse, I think this is it. If you are a high-end type, this isn't it.I will update when the battery dies, currently it has one AA Eneloop that was fully charged when installed.[Edit, a month after purchase, I like it okay, but I think the 4 stars will stick and I very much wish that I'd gotten one with a off switch and/or a clip -  I would've payed $10-15 more for these things.]",How is the grip?,['The grip on the thumb side feels good'],[863],[1],[0.6],[ True]

I'm not going to say great but it's pretty good for the price. I did some extensive homework before I bought this as I was looking for a smart tv that offered an alternative to hooking it up to several components for a guest bedroom. Instead I liked it so much that I ended up putting this in my bedroom and switching it out with a slightly older Sylvania flat screen I had (great picture) for the guest room. The slim, sleekness of it takes a little getting used to in terms of the screen- you have a thinner frame and more screen to look at if that makes sense. The apps and streaming are pretty good for what you get and Vizio is constantly updating to add more apps. There is a slight learning curve when trying to link it up with your wifi however I found that by turning it off & on after the initial info is entered helped in terms of getting the tv to connect. It took two tries for me but afterwards it was smooth sailing. Again the Netflix, Hulu and other apps are good. There's some interesting freebie channel apps where you can watch old tv shows in there too at no cost so that's kind of nice to have. My favorite feature of this television hands down is the ability to plug in a usb drive and play multiple types of video files automatically without having to hook it up to a PC or DVD player. You can also play mp3 files and look at photos, etc. but I was really impressed by the number of files it would play without too much of a problem. The remote that comes with the TV is a sore spot here and I'll tell you why. They provide you with a smart tv that allows you to access online streaming and other applications yet you get this remote that is more for a basic TV with no buttons such as for launching Netflix or other hotkeys for the streaming apps it offers. This is where Vizio literally Cheapens out this model. The remote is also small, lengthy and complicated in terms of a million tiny keys. There is also no keyboard. You would think that a smart tv would come equipped with a remote that offered a keyboard yet it does not. I realized this is part of the reason why this tv is a bit of a bargain compared to other smart TVs out there. At any rate, I resolved this by replacing the remote with the VIZIO XRV1TV Qwerty keyboard remote (bought here on Amazon for about $12). I know this is not ideal for some because the idea is that you get a brand new tv and you shouldn't have to spend extra $$ on an additional remote however I recommend it in this case as the little cheap universal that comes with this set will drive you mad. You really do want a remote with a Qwerty Keyboard on the back as this will come in handy if/when you do a search on youtube or Netflix or Hulu--you won't be there forever trying to navigate letters on-screen with the up/down remote toggle keys (eyes rolling). Now for the rest of this thing- it's got great picture and some pretty good choice settings for gaming, etc. You just have to get in there and explore it. Some people have complained that the picture looks dimmer than when they saw it on the showroom floor however I just found that I adjusted the controls and it seems to be fine. I believe also that this set has an automatic sensor built-in that adjusts the brightness of the screen depending on the level of light in the room. I have not played with it enough to find out for sure whether or not this is something you can turn off or adjust. There are only two HDMI connections and that can be bothersome to some. For me this wasn't an issue as I don't always hook this up to a PC however it was good to have it hooked up to my cable box but honestly two connections was fine for me. Gamers and PC enthusiasts may get irritated at this small amount of HDMI connections so buyer beware there. Again, this was one of the cheapest smart tv models out there with good reviews that I found so i'm not too surprised it lacks a few things. Some folks have complained at the slowness of the TV to power on and I will say it takes about 20-30 seconds which can get on your nerves. All I can say there is to just have some patience and resist the urge to keep hitting the power switch as I learned the hard way you might actually activate a hard-reset of the television by doing that. That brings me to mention a safety feature the tv has built-in in the event of a power surge or storm. I came home one evening after a wicked rain storm to find the tv buzzing at me every few seconds after I'd turned it on. It kept making a noise similar to those you hear when a weather bulletin flashes on your screen from your local news, etc. I couldn't get the TV to stop doing this so after trying to adjust the settings for a good half hour and finding no solution to this I did some research on the net and found this was a result of a built in sensor that is designed to protect the TV from shorting out if an electrical surge occurs (which apparently did). So the solution to this was to power it off and unplug it from the power source for a good 20 minutes. Once we did this, it came right back on and adjusted to normal as if nothing had happened. Overall it's a very interesting unit with good picture and a fairly good amount of &#34;smart&#34; apps for an entry level smart tv.",How is the remote?,[],[],[],[],[]

I received it a few days later. It was great timing because I was just getting ready to leave on a business trip. I rapidly removed it from the box.  My initial impression was great. Starting from the cool box to the wireless keyboard case. The case looks great. It feels very sturdy and nice looking.  It is little thicker than my old case (another great case from NewTrend Airbend 2.0 (NT510K)).Next, I had to charge the case to use it. I had only a few hours left before I left. Now the charging process is a little strange.  The manual says that the light indicator should be lighted in RED, but I never saw it. I waited and eventually the light turned BLUE  (maybe the RED indicator only shows when the battery is dead. I will have to post an update once the first charge is over).Then came it came to placing my iPad Air into the new case. I struggled a little. The case is very tight. It is harder to take it apart.  Putting it together was very easy once I figured out how to take it apart. Each of the important input places are protected by a small tab which fits perfectly and makes the iPad well protected.  The case comes with a screen protector which is nice (I already have my screen protector), but I figured it will provide a double protection.  Now I had everything ready for my trip.When I boarded my flight, I was finally ready to use it.  First I needed to open the case to the position that felt most comfortable. There is a release button in the on the side of the case that releases the extension arm.  I pulled it too far and it came apart.  It was no problem. Pressed the button and placed the extension arm to the right level.  Now, I was truly ready to use it, but before I use it I had to pair the wireless keyboard and my iPad Air (updated to the last iOS).  First, I could not figure out how to turn on the keyboard. I did not read the manual, but I eventually figured that I need to hold the on/off button for a few seconds to turn it on and off. Then I pressed the pairing button which connected easily to my iPad.  Used extensively the keyboard during my 10 hours flight. I wrote emails and made notes in preparations for my upcoming client meetings. The keyboard felt nice. It was not clunky and was a good size.  With my first Airbender 2.0, I had some problems with the keyboard freezing my iPad which this worked perfectly.  During my trip, the passenger next to me commented about the case too. He said it looks really nice.During the week and my flight back, the case was still working perfectly. So far, no problems. I took some pictures with iPhone 5s. These may not be the greatest pictures, but it will provide you with some sense of this great case. If you have iPad and wants it to be protected and a great wireless keyboard, you must consider the Newtrend Airbender Pro (NT610KR)!Durability~5  (so far, no issue to report)Functionality~5 (it has all of the options I would want)Quality~5  (so far it has been great and fun to use it)Protective Capability~5 (this is a fantastic case)Shipping of product~5  (the box is pretty cool too)",Where can I feel my device?,[],[],[],[],[]

I selected this model based on the Amazon reviews, then bounced over to Conzumer Reportz and found that it was one of the top rated models in this size.  Based on my first week's use, I have to agree with both the Amazon and CR reviewers.  The TV is super light weight, and therefore a breeze to mount on a wall (it also comes with a plastic ""foot"" that lets you set it on a cabinet or table if you want).  Setup was very simple -- it connected to my router through the built-in WiFi connection, and registering the TV to my online media accounts (e.g., Amazon Prime for TV/movies) took a matter of seconds.  The picture quality is very good -- better than I expected for this price.  The sound is OK -- good for a second TV, but if I planned to watch a lot of movies on this set I'd probably hook it up to better speakers.  The web content apps (Amazon Prime, YouTube, Netflix, etc.) work well and easily, but the load times are significantly slower than on my PC, and typing on the on-screen soft keyboard is slow.  The TV does not have a general purpose browser, so you're limited to the apps Vizio supports.  The Sony Blu-ray player I hooked up the Vizio TV has a browser, so the lack of a browser in the TV set itself wasn't a big deal for me, but I wish it were clearer in the product description (references to Internet and WiFi led me to assume I could get onto the Internet from the TV).Bottom line:  A very good quality picture, OK sound, with built-in wifi and easy-to-use apps, all for around two fifty make this an exceptional value.

The user interface (UI) installed on the Vizio E320i-A0 is Vizio's crippled Yahoo! TV Apps/M-GO interface, NOT the company's ""Vizio Internet Apps Plus"" interface.  It is clunky, frustrating, limited, and NOT user friendly.  While the TV is just fine as standard TV or monitor, and has a decent picture, adequate sound, and plenty of inputs, the UI is terrible and the remote is almost worthless.  It is not a good value as it comes at a premium over a similarly appointed HD set, and you can save nearly a C-note and a whole bunch of frustration if you simply buy a ""dumb"" 32-inch HD set and a Roku LT from Amazon.I purchased this TV in January 2013 on Vizio's promise that it would provide an outstanding Smart TV experience.  It was anything BUT outstanding.  Its primary app, ""M-GO"" (prominently displayed on both the unit's UI home screen and its lousy remote control), was billed as a ""revolutionary"" TV experience when I purchased the TV.  Bizarrely, M-GO wasn't installed on the TV at the time of purchase and didn't even become available for it until Summer 2013.  When it finally did arrive via Vizio's eventual firmware update, M-GO turned out to be all ""pay"" TV - no included content.  It was thoroughly disappointing and not ""revolutionary"" as promised.  I already have Netflix and Amazon Prime, so I don't need their lousy pay app.  Aside from M-GO, there are other apps available for the E320i-A0 -- some are preinstalled like Yahoo! Finance and Skype, but most are downloaded through the Yahoo! TV Apps store in the unit's poorly structured UI.  Strangely, Yahoo! TV Apps offers only a very limited number of apps for this ""smart"" TV -- a grand total of 134 (that's right:  ONLY ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR!) as of this writing on December 26, 2013 -- and most of them are either local news station apps from distant corners of the U.S., or paid anime/cartoon channels. Even the familiar apps like iHeart Radio have limited feature sets and don't offer the programmable, personalized channels you would customarily be able to set up on your computer or smart phone, but rather offer only a specified set of broadcast stations from select markets.  The entire experience is really bizarre.Ultimately, the greatest disappointment of the E320i-A0 is its abysmal UI and limited apps, which Vizio flatly informed me it has no intention to update to its current ""VIA Plus"" interface.  Again, the TV is good in terms of picture, size, sound and inputs, but the ""smart"" content is worthless.  If you buy this TV you will be stuck with the lousy UI, crappy remote, and crippled apps.  Be forewarned, and get a ""dumb"" TV and a Roku (or Chromecast, or XBox 360, etc); you'll be much happier you did.",What is the screen size of your tv?,['32-inch'],[761],[4],[0.],[False]

All I have seen are mostly positive reviews for this product. However, my experience is different:First use - First ticketDrove I-75 From Orlando to Atlanta and back. Just decided to use new 9500ix for the trip in a car. I originally picked up the unit for use on a motorcycle. On the way it picked up traffic light cameras as well as K Band and regular radar. I noticed a number of patrol cars parked in plain sight on the center median perpendicular to the traffic lanes. Thought it kind of funny that I never had a peep from the detector for one of these cars. On the way back I found out why. Bingo a speeding ticket and never heard any type of warning from the detector. Laser!!! This thing does not pick it up. I'm sure it a good unit for conventional Radar but that is becoming obsolete. I would wait and buy a unit that is designed for the new wave of laser that will be in wide spread use and will replace Radar in the near future. Unfortunately, while the company claims that the unit offers some protection against laser I have not had it make any sound or warning whatsoever. So, I have to give the product an F.It seems like more and more law enforcement are going to laser. This is old school technology. It may work ok for regular radar and has a lot of bells and whistles some which you have to pay added subscription charges for. However most are not worth the money and I would have to consider this unit way overpriced.In retrospect, I should have bought a cheaper radar detector, and waited for a good laser/radar detector in this price range. The 9500ix cost way too much for what it offers. In a year it will be as obsolete as a land line phone",When do a solid performance?,['I should have bought a cheaper radar detector'],[1519],[1],[0.],[False]

Fortunately for Logitech there aren't many companies bothering to design these types of keypads.It's made well enough. No complaints regarding the build quality.The problems lay in the design.I don't know who designed the thumb stick, but if you don't replace it yourself (which requires taking the device apart, or gluing/sanding) it's just terrible as a AWSD input. Anyways, I would fire the designer of it. He clearly is not good. Even the five star reviews will tell you that.The LCD is a gimmick. I don't know what else to say about it. The only reason you'll probably use it is to swap profiles, which I'll mention in the next part.The software is terrible. Sometimes you'll have to program the device every time you boot up, because the file won't save correctly. Even worse is that it will sometimes revert back to an older setting, or lose a profile, months after you thought it finally was working.So, what does this all mean. Well, because the Nostromo is no longer as good as it once was, we're pretty much stuck with the G13. On the other hand, Logitech did a terrible job on it, considering the price point. It's basically a bunch of keys, a worthless LCD screen, a terrible joystick, and bad software to make it worse.Hopefully a competitor will go into this niche field and design something better. Logitech is obviously more interested in making it look fancy, than having it work well.***EDIT***Well, at the time of this editing ""0 of 7 people found this review helpful."" It's possible that all of them work at Logitech; who knows. I've adjusted the review to now be 3 stars, mostly because I was probably a little overly harsh. The fact is, I still own and use my G13. It's not perfect, especially considering the price point for what is essentially a mini keyboard with a silly LCD and bad joystick, but it's still the best product in the niche field (once modified by the owner). That said, if Razer goes back to the quality of the original Nostromo produced by Belkin, then I will be switching brands.",How is the software?,"['The software is terrible'

The S95 allows you to go full manual but the SX260 gives you many options to play with your photo taking. Overall, if I could only take one camera I would take the SX260 because the optical zoom and picture quality is great.

Many people may start comparing this product to the iPod touch, but there are many aspects of PMP (portable media player), including the price (you get 16GB for one-hundred-sixty dollars, where for an iPod, you get 8GB for two-hundred-twenty dollars), that make the Zune HD a better choice and a strong competitor with today's leading PMP's.||>>APPEARANCEWhen I first opened up my Zune box and took it out, I was amazed. The Zune is extremely light and durable. The brushed metal back to the Zune gives it an industrial, yet sleek look. And since the screen is OLED, you can barely see where the screen boundaries are on the device. Overall, this probably one of the best looking devices I've ever seen (and I've seen tons of PMP's).||>>EASE OF USEThe user interface is amazing. It's definitely the best UI I've seen in a while. On the whole screen, there are options for music, pictures, videos, podcasts, internet, marketplace, social, and settings. Each sub-menu after that is pretty much the same. For music, you can view the music by artists, albums, genres, or songs (just a list of the 500 songs or whatever). You can switch between these different viewing options by swiping it to the left or right. The Zune performs these actions flawlessly.||>>INTERNET BROWSERAlong with all the other features packed into this device, the Zune sports a great browser. According to some sources, the browser is a slightly modified version of Internet Explorer 6. It seems pretty outdated, but many of the websites I go to have a mobile version that works just as well. Overall, loading pages is sometimes fast, and sometimes slow. It really depends on wi-fi network you're on. I'm pretty impressed with the quality of the web browser in terms of scrolling, and typing in text (the on-screen keyboard is great). The only thing I wish the Zune had was YouTube support, but with all of the music I have, I can manage not going on YouTube.||>>PORTABILITYThis devices is extremely light. It weighs around 70 grams, while the iPhone 3GS weighs about 150 grams. The devices is about 2 inches wide and 4 inches tall, with a screen that's 3.25 inches diagonally. The perfect dimension make the Zune extremely easy to carry around with me wherever I go, and also perfect for holding in my hand. I recommend buying a case (Incipio Feather Case for Zune HD (Black)) for this device.||>>SOUND QUALITYThe sound quality on this device is much better than the iPod touch. All my friends have iPods or iPhones, and even they say that my Zune sound quality blows theirs away. There are many different EQ settings for the music; acoustic, classical, electronic, hip hop, jazz, pop, and rock. I would probably say acoustic and pop are the most well-balanced options on the device, but different people have different ears. You might like different EQ settings, not to mention different headphones have different sound quality too.||>>BATTERY LIFEThe battery life on this device is a little bit better than the average PMP. With the brightness on low, wireless off, and the volume at 15 out of 30, I could probably get about 15 hours of battery life. The battery life also, depends on the bitrate of the movies or songs that you're listening to, as higher bitrates mean lower battery life. Most of my songs are 320 kbps, which is fairly high, so my battery life approximations may or may not be accurate.||>>SCREEN QUALITYThe OLED screen on this device is AMAZING. The resolution is 480x272, which isn't true HD resolution, but you can output HD video with the dock, which is sold separately. The colors on the screen are extremely bright and vivid, and the blacks are extremely dark. And the thing about OLED screens is that when they're displaying black pixels, the screen simply isn't being lit up at those pixels. So, having a lot of black really saves a lot of battery life, not to mention the whites look much, much better on OLED screens then any other screen. HOWEVER, if you're displaying a lot of white, the battery life drains a little faster than usual, which doesn't really matter that much because most of the menus are black anyway. If I was stuck on an island with nothing but my Zune HD and a couply of movies, I would be happy. :)||>>HEADPHONE QUALITYThe headphones that come with the device are pretty good. The only problem that I have with them is the bass response, so if you're an audiophile like myself, then you'll probably want to get new, better headphones. The headphones themselves are built extremely well and last a long time (longer than the generic Apple headphones). Also, the ear buds have little magnets on the ends of them which is kind of cool.||>>VERSATILITYThis device can play music, pictures, videos, podcasts (for free from the Zune Marketplace), browse the internet, download songs (and albums), and run some apps. So overall, this device has a pretty good range of things it can do. However, there isn't any integrated speaker, so you won't be able to watch videos or listen to music without headphones or separate speakers.||>>APPSThe apps selection is pretty limited. At the time of this review, there are probably only about 40-50 apps, most of which are simple 2D games. But they have a Facebook app, email app, and a twitter app, which I find quite useful at times.||>>SOFTWAREI've used iTunes before and I have to say, the Zune software totally blows iTunes out of the water. The interface is just so much faster. It looks nicer, instead of those bland Excel spreadsheets. When you're playing a song, the background automatically changes into a collage of different albums but that band, similar artists, artists photos, and some other stuff. Overall, the software is excellent, and really adds to the Zune experience.||>>MUSIC SUBSCRIPTIONS OPTIONSFor one-hundred-forty dollars a year, you can buy a Zune PASS. The Zune Pass is a subscription services that allows you to download an UNLIMITED amount of music for the time you're subscribed, along with 10 additional songs per month that you can keep forever. So, if you buy a 1-year subscription to the Zune Pass, you can download unlimited songs for a year, keep them on you computer, Zune, or Windows phone, and then listen to them whenever you want. Then, at the end of the subscription, you can download 120 of those songs to keep forever, even when you aren't subscribed. And if you stay subscribed, you can just continue like nothing ever happened, and then at the end of the 2 years, you can download 240 songs from the collection. Having the freedom to download as many songs as I want until my Zune gets full is really fun, and I would really recommend a Zune Pass to anyone who's thinking of getting a Zune.||>>VERDICTThe Zune HD is an excellent devices for anyone who wants a rich and filling digital media experience. The Zune might have some flaws, like not very many apps, and no YouTube support, but for the most part, the Zune shines. I would recommend this PMP over an iPod anyday. If you want tons of apps, and YouTube, you should probably consider getting an iPod, but if you want an amazing multimedia experience, be sure to consider getting a Zune.--Bob",What is the sound quality?,"['QUALITYThe sound quality on this device is much better than the iPod touch'

The copy on the drive was corrupted, so I downloaded a fresh copy from the Seagate website. That worked OK, but I could never get the automated backup to work. According to the included manual, on the Home page of Seagate dashboard there is a ""protect"" button to start the backup process. I never got this button to show itself.* The other major selling point of the Dashboard is the ability to backup data/images from Facebook, Flicker and YouTube. I am not quite sure why I would want to do this, and my natural paranoia keeps me from giving Facebook any sort of access to anything having to do with my local drive. To its credit, the Dashboard software seems to allow disabling of this access. Still-just makes me nervous-I don't trust Facebook to be anywhere near my personal drive.* Installing the Dashboard software seemed to load a LOT of software-look like a whole Microsoft C++ distribution kit.  The uninstall seems to mostly work (it did throw an error for a file not found. Unfortunately it didn't seem to offer the option to uninstall all the Microsoft stuff in downloaded, and I am not sure where exactly it put it.

I was impressed that a touch screen would be fairly affordable (similar non-touch laptops were in the $500-600 range, so this wasn't a big jump).  I was also excited about the hybrid hard drive, so I took the plunge and bought it.First of all, it's a gorgeous computer.  The brushed black back is lovely and the computer is sleek and smooth and beautiful.  I was already in love when I took it out of the box.  It's light--4 lbs--and super easy to fit into a backpack or even a large purse.  I turned it on, set up Windows 8 (which is initially confusing as heck, even for someone who is totally comfortable using computers), and I started playing with the apps so that I could get a sense of how well the touch screen worked.  I had no problem using the gestures, like pinch to zoom, two-finger scrolling, and panning.  It's as sensitive as any tablet I've used.  Wonderful!  I did briefly have trouble with the touchpad, but after installing all the Asus updates and Windows 8 updates, all is well.  You can do all of the same gestures on the touchpad, by the way.  And the touchpad is huge!  I like it, but it's different than what I'm used to.Okay, so on to the other stuff.  Just so you know, I am a PhD student, so I often have multiple programs open: Google Chrome, Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Adobe Reader, etc.  I don't require the kind of CPU and memory as someone who does more intensive computing or gaming, but I do notice when things begin to lag.  Things I care about: USB 3.0 (there is one), the touch screen, the sound quality, and ability to run 3-6 programs smoothly and quickly.  As I said, the touch screen is great.  The sound quality is also surprisingly good, and it gets significantly louder than my old laptop.  With headphones plugged in, the sound is excellent, even at the lowest volumes (I've been listening at approx. 12% volume).  And the computer has been great with multiple programs.  I have only had it for a few days, but I've been putting it through the ringer.  So far, it's passed with flying colors.  It's gorgeous, it runs smoothly and quickly for my needs, and it seems to be an awesome product.  This computer and I are a match made in heaven.",How heavy is the laptop?,['light--4 lbs'],[497],[4],[0.],[False]

After the second time I decided to switch from Linksys (been a fanboy for the past decade) - and I couldn't be more happier. The vertical range on this unit is far superior to the e3k - that is 3 stories above it and I have near 4/5 bars on my cell phone and laptop. Whereas the e3k was between 2/5 - 3/5. Likewise a test 1 floor up and about 250 feet away gave me 3/5 bars - nearly full bandwidth speed. I can also transfer on my internal network at nearly 60MB/s when in good signal - something I'd never achieve with the e3k. I wish I had better benchmarks however since the e3k is dead I couldn't do solid tests to compare it with. However I can state without a doubt, every location I could stand in my house and outside my house - I got better signal. Likewise any location I could stand in I got faster bandwidth both internally and externally (that is I could get my full 50mb/s download bandwidth from my ISP - where my e3k I rarely saw get above 35).If I had to point out any flaws with this unit it would probably be the weird base/mount that it sits on to elevate the back end. It's useful and almost needed for cooling (like most high end routers - this gets hot), however it doesnt sit so well on it, they couldve made it so it slid in/attached somehow so it seemd more solid.Also to note this router is fully supported by DDWRT - I've been running it several months without any issues. There were some weird stock firmware isues with Asus when I first got it, but Asus has since resolved. Their stock firmware is pretty decent, functional, and will suffice for most users I'm sure.

I have been thinking about getting a tablet for each of my daughters and have been reading reviews and checking out every device I can get my hands on.  I know I didn't want the el-cheepo tablets you can get for $99.  I've seen those and checked them out and they are tablets, but generally have older operating system, lack support, and don't support all the apps.  I didn't want a limited device.  I also didn't want to spend $350 per device either.  I have heard of people that got the Kindles and were very happy with them so I decided to take a chance and get 2 of them.  For the price of the refurb devices, with a percentage off e-coupon that I had, plus using my amazon points from my Amazon credit card, I was able to basically get 2 of these for the price of one.  I set my expectations a bit low because I didn't think of them as full tablets, but I'm happy to report I was rather wrong in that area.  I was very, very impressed with the Kindle Fire HD 7 inch tablet.  I have a full 10 inch Acer Iconia tablet that I like and my kids like but it's a bit large for them.  This is the perfect size and feels so good in the hands.  The screen is very clear, and the sound these things produce is just amazing.  I couldn't believe how amazing the sound on these is, and how loud!  My kids are getting them for Christmas and I can't wait to see their jaws hit the ground!  Amazon uses a custom interface for the Android OS, but it doesn't make it any less functional. It is a bit different getting used to compared with the standard Android interface, but it works fine.  It was able to do pretty much whatever I wanted to do with it.  Once you get used to the different interface, it's just as easy to get around in it as anything else, and if it's your first exposure to the world of tablet devices, I think it would be much easier to learn and get comfortable with.  I can't be happier with these things and actually, even though I have a 10 inch tablet, I'm very much considering getting one of these for me too.  I like it that much.Now, as for the refurbished part, don't be afraid of that word.  I get refurb stuff all the time and so far, here's what my experience is... they are great!  It seems like the refurb items have had all the bugs worked out and have had more rigorous testing than the new devices.  I've had plenty of new things stop working on me and had to get them replaced or repaired, but I've never had one single refurb device have any issue at all... ever (knock on wood!!).  These had no signs of ever having been used.  Not one single scratch or blemish, and Amazon's support is growing to be legend.  They want people to be happy with their purchases and will go the extra mile to ensure you are, so the support they offer is very good.I guess the bottom line is, if you are looking to get a tablet to start into the tablet world, or want something for the kids, then you have to consider this.

I have experienced some softness out beyond 200mm while using it on auto-focus, but I am learning to work within the limits of the lens. Given what has been said in some reviews about softness out past 200mm (and my own initial experience) I decided to run some tests for how sharp the pictures could really be. The one caveat I had is that for the tests I ran I used manual focus - I wanted to test the optics not the AF or VR functions since they are not a requirement for using the lens. Also, I am starting to get very interested in Equestrian photography. I need the long zoom and have found that pre-focusing on a point, rather than depending on Auto-focus is much more effective for obtaining the results I am looking for.For my test I used this lens mounted on a D300 to take some pictures of a bell tower. Because I was specifically testing the lens for sharpness past 200mm (I shot several at 300mm) I focused the lens manually, and used a tripod. As it turned out there was chain link fencing over the opening to the bell which I could not see, from where I was standing in a parking lot across the street. That made my test even better.I then took several shots of the bell and the tower, being careful to focus the lens on specific characteristics of the bell. The shots were all sharp. I then downloaded and examined the photos at high magnification on my PC. I did not lose any significant resolution of the chain link (which I could only make out after I downloaded the pictures) or the objects I was focused upon until I viewing the shots at 200% or greater magnification. At that point you could actually begin to see the individual pixels. So I have to say that I do not agree with the reviews about how the lens gives poor results out past 200mm. I have obtained excellent results through the entire zoom range.I will say that the AF-S system for the lens seems to hunt a lot when there are a lot of objects in the field of view (i.e., the leaves on a tree while trying to photograph a bird), so it does sometimes focus on something other that what I want - that could have been what the others were complaining about. But if I assure myself that it is focused on my target and use the AF lock built into the camera that problem goes away. Also if I use the lens on manual focus the problem goes away.I am very happy with the lens and highly recommend it. I believe it is an outstanding value for the price.",Is the focus of the binoculars simple and accurate?,[],[],[],[],[]

I also have an iPad 3. I have worked in IT for the past few years so I would say I am pretty good with technology and fancy new devices. With that introduction out of the way, I will be reviewing key points that I have seen touched upon in other reviews. Here goes...BUILDThe device feels nice and solid. I'm a little surprised at how heavy it is, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The rubberized backing is always nice for added grip. It's not as nice as say unibody aluminum, but it's not $500 either.SCREENThe screen is fantastic. But my problem is the same as when iPad got Retina Display, other than the OS, most apps look rather pixelated. A lot of the games I tried are not high definition, at least not high enough to look smooth on this screen. Hopefully apps get updated to higher resolutions.LOCK SCREEN ADSYeah there are ads on my lock screen. I'm not sure why this is such a big deal. How much time do people really spend looking at the lock screen? The first thing I thought when I saw the ads is WOW the pictures are really crisp! The ads are there to subsidize some of the $200 price tag. I might pay the $15 to get rid of them so I can customize it, but I might not. I feel like this has been blown out of proportion by other customers.SOUNDThe sound from the speakers is great. Much better than you would get from more expensive devices, very crisp and clean. I have the official Amazon case on and it has not affected the sound at all. Nothing much else to say, I doubt anyone will complain about this.CRASHINGI've had two apps crash on opening. I don't know if it is the app or the OS. It's probably somewhere in the middle. Again, not a big deal for me. If it crashes, then I just tap it again and it works. I've also watched a few movies using the built in player as well as Netflix and Amazon Prime. No crashes for me at all. I'm sure OS stability will be improved as time goes on.OVERALL SATISFACTIONCompared to my iPad 3, obviously the Fire HD is not as ""good"" so to speak. I mainly got it because I wanted something smaller. I also mainly used the iPad to surf the web, watch videos, and play some simple games. The Fire HD accomplishes this and does so much more. If you are expecting an iPad killer, or a desktop replacement, or a productivity machine, then you should look elsewhere.I bought this to be a media device, and I believe that is what Amazon meant this to be. In this regard, I think this is a great device. In fact, I decided to keep this and sell my iPad 3, which will give me another $200+ to spend on other things. Just remember, this device is not for everyone. If you want a media device, you will be happy with this. Do not expect an iPad for $200.UPDATE 9/18/12Just wanted to add a few more things I have noticed over the past 24 hours.- Power/Volume Buttons: There are a bit hard to press, which is somewhat alleviated by having the official case. Maybe it's because I'm a longtime iPad user, but this will definitely take some getting used to.- Screen Glare: It took me a little while to notice, but I was playing a Seek & Find game while on Caltrain, with the bright Palo Alto sun shining right on me, and didn't have any trouble seeing the screen. I remembered that Amazon mentioned how the screen was changed to reduce glare, and they did an amazing job.UPDATE 9/20/12Two days later and I am still very happy with the device. Here are some more thoughts from me:BATTERY LIFEI have been playing Enigmatis (a hidden object game) for about an hour and a half each day on my commute. This drains about 15 - 20% of the battery with the screen brightness almost at the highest setting. Again, not iPad gold standard, but still very good.SYNCING MUSICI have a Samsung Galaxy S3 and used an app called Easy Phone Transfer to get all my music from iTunes onto the phone. It transferred everything, including album covers, and I was hoping to find something like that for this device. I tried iSyncr, a $3 app, which did the job, but did not sync over album covers. I uploaded all my music into the Cloud, then downloaded it from Amazon, which increased the audio quality for a lot of my songs and added artwork, but this still did not show up on the device.I got very frustrated getting all the album artwork over and eventually just gave up. It's not a big deal but I am kind of anal about those kinds of things. Just a heads up if anyone else out there is crazy about it like I am.UPDATE 09/21/12I got a call from Amazon Customer Service about this review, which surprised me very much. They advised me the best way to get the artwork to show up is have the songs in both the Cloud Player as well as the device, which I know does work fine. I was hoping to have the artwork show without needing things in the Cloud, but not a big deal any more.I am more impressed with the fact that Amazon called me to give me advice on how to remedy the situation and ask if there were any other questions I had on the Kindle. The representative said he wanted to make sure I was happy with the Fire HD. This is one of the big reasons I went with the Kindle, and with Amazon in general. I have had great experiences with their customer service, who have always been able to handle my issues quickly and efficiently. No need to set up an appointment days later with a wannabe IT guy with a hugely overstated job title.So this update is not really for the device itself, but sometimes it's not just the device, it's the company that offers it that makes a difference. This is why I no longer have any Apple devices, as cool as they may be. But it's not 100% gravy, as I have noticed lately that the keyboard keeps popping up randomly on screens where there is nowhere to enter text, ie. while playing a game. I just have to press the Back arrow to get rid of it, but maybe a bug the Amazon engineers want to take a look at.UPDATE 10/05/12So I don't know if it was always there, but over this past weekend I noticed a dead pixel on my Kindle's screen. I called Kindle Support and after a short 5 minute call, they sent me a new Kindle, no questions asked. So once again, very happy with Amazon customer service. I am still very happy with the device, and have some more thoughts on it:HDMI CONNECTIONI bought an HDMI cable to hook up the Fire to my 46"" Samsung and was quite impressed with the results. The quality was very good, not Bluray quality of course, but better than SDTV on an HD screen. You actually see every single thing you do on the big screen, like you are using a giant Kindle.GOOGLE PLAY APPSOne of the main drawbacks in my opinion is, or should I say was, the lack of all the Google Play apps available on the Kindle. With a little research, I found out how to add apps that are not available in the Amazon store. It is pretty easy to do and works very well with the apps I tried. This greatly improves my opinion of the Fire HD.PLASTIC AROUND THE SCREENThe outer most edges of the Kindle are plastic. I noticed some kind of discoloration on the corner of mine, and just thought it was some dirt to scratch off. So I rubbed my thumb nail on the area, and noticed there were visible marks on the plastic. It appears this plastic can scratch some what easily, but I think this is just cosmetic as not of the plastic actually flaked. If you are not very anal about how your stuff looks, you probably won't notice it.OS CHANGESHere are two small gripes I have with the OS that I'm sure could be fixed with an OS update:- Battery Meter: It would be nice if the battery meter could show percentage instead of just a graphic bar. Some people have mentioned Battery HD, but you still have to swipe down to see the percentage, so this makes it easier but does not solve the issue I had.- Personal Videos: The mp4 videos I put on the device are located in the ""Personal Videos"" app, which shows screen shots of all the videos I put in. The problem is, all that is shown are the screen shots. You can get more info by holding your finger down on each video, but when you have multiple seasons of a show on the Kindle, it can get confusing. Ideally we should be able to look at videos in a list like our music.UPDATE 11/15/12Still very happy with the device. Here are some more thoughts:LEFT HAND MODEI did't think this would be a problem until I played a Solitaire game that DID have a left-handed mode. As a lefty who usually uses the Fire in landscape, I often have to reach across the screen to access the Settings or Home button in the menu. It's a small grievance, but can be really annoying when watching a movie or reading something. If there was an option for a left-handed layout with the menus on the left side of the device, that would be great.PERSONAL VIDEOS APPI had earlier complained about this app, as it did not list my movies and crashed playing a pair of them. I recently drove down to LA from SF, and put 5 movies on device, only to find that 4 of them would not play! I was pretty mad, until I remembered a simple solution, download another app. I downloaded Avia Media Player, which is not the greatest either, but it played all the movies I put on the Kindle. My faith was restored.GOOGLE PLAY APPSA lot of people have asked how to do this.

So far, I have owned this tablet for only a week but I have owned previous tablets longer than that. I have to say that my Toshiba tablet had NO light bleed to speak of. The sound on that one wasn't real great though. It also had no LED flash for the rear camera. The TF300T is a nice tablet by ASUS but, still no flash for the rear camera and the ""stereo"" speakers are placed far to the right of the back of the tablet as is the same with the TF700T which I am now using. It, however, does have an LED flash, a very bright one I might add. The folks that said the flash wasn't very bright, I don't know whom you were trying to kid. Now, the sound on this tablet isn't as good and rich sounding as the speakers for the TF300T, even though the placement is the same...to the far right in the back. That bothers me a little but not enough to send it back yet.As far as that darn light bleed. Well, this one has one spot towards the bottom that is very noticeable and then a few areas towards the right of the screen that show up also. But you know what people, it is my experience that once that tablet is fully booted up and you have all the images on the screen and the auto brightness has adjusted itself to a mid level, the ""bleed"" is no longer noticeable. I don't understand the people that have huge complaints about it enough to say they returned their tablets because of it. The screen is very nice and very responsive. Even in IPS mode for outside viewing, I can barely tell of any light bleed and it surely isn't enough to project across my screen. If you are out in the bright sun with the IPS mode on and the bightness at full, the sun's rays still block out what you think one could detect as ""light bleed"" so again, I don't understand what all the fuss is about! It's still not bothering me enought to return the tablet. The one I really wanted actually was the Toshiba Excite but the reviews were much lower than this one. I still feel in some way I should've got the Toshiba instead (thus the 4 stars of this tablet). At least it places its ""stereo"" speakers as right and left side speakers and not just all the way on the right side. It also has an LED flash.I'm not really going to comment on what bloat software it comes with becaue I didn't feel it actually has all that much extra apps installed to worry about. I'm also not going to comment on how well it runs all that software. I have found that from tablet to tablet, they all pretty much do the same thing with just a little bit difference in the design. That part is just to each one's own preferance. I've done the system update to the newest android version. The tablet as a whole seems to function well. I would recommend it to my friends but I also would suggest that they might want to research more and and maybe check out the Toshiba Excite or other brands and come to their own conclusions.",What receptivity does the touch screen have?,[],[],[],[],[]

Either the ear buds were way out of my price range or they seemed to be unreliable. Everyone raved about the original Tone Bluetooth headset, but said it sounded tinny. This set caught my eye because a lot of reviewers said they sounded better than the originals. However, there were a lot of complaints about these headphones dropping connection with the device in a front pocket or only a foot or so away. Other people said they had no problems. It was one reviewer who mentioned that it could be an issue with an older protocol on older phones. Because of his review I decided to take a chance and get them, if I didn't like them I could send them back. (I have an LG Nexus 4 phone.)These arrived, a birthday present I picked out, and I synced them to my phone. They synced effortlessly. I simply turned them on and pressed the button on top that flashed blue. Went into my settings and turned on the Bluetooth and had it search for new devices. It found the headphones, I tapped, they paired, done. I turned on some music, sounded great. I would say it has plenty of base and a nice range. I use the poweramp app, so I was able to tune them the way I like my music to sound. Would I say they would compete with 300.00 headphones, no. But they sound really good for the price. I made a couple of phone calls, clarity was great. Everyone I called said it sounded like I was just talking normal on my phone. The only issue I had was a brother who talked to me over a speaker phone, it sounded echoey, but that was on his end. Everyone else sounded great. I fiddled with the settings and volume, everything works great. As to connectivity, on my Nexus 4, I put my phone in my pants pocket and did my normal tasks, sound never lost quality or dropped. Put it in my back pocket, same result. Decided that evening to check how far away I could get before it would dropp. I left my phone on its charger and walked out of my bedroom on one side of the house to my living room on the other side, the sound quality dropped a little when I got to the far end of the living room, as soon as I stopped the sound quality returned to normal and I finished listening to the song. I then walked downstairs to my basement all the way to the other side and the sound quality cut out for a split second and recovered as soon as I stopped walking. I sat at my computer and listened to music for almost an hour with only a few momentarily noticeable drops in quality and or sound. I figured that was a good enough test for me. I would say that the connectivity equals that of the older model as described in many reviews. So why do some of us rave about these headphones and others curse them? I can only assume that the reviewer who mentioned needing a newer phone with an upgraded protocol was right. With my Nexus phone, they are stellar. Only time will if they are durable.

No more. This camera can take shots as good -and sometimes better- as my trusted DSLR.Take a look at my sample shots at [...]PORTABILITYThis camera fits in my hand, in my pocket and in my laptop bag. In fact, I am using the case for my wife's Lumix TZ8. I can bring this camera with me anywhere.One big advantage is safety: if you travel to places that are not 100% safe, any potential robber would mistake it with a cheap $200 camera. More importantly, you will nevr have to leave this camera in a hotel room, on the trunk of your car, or will have to carry a big backpack with camera and accessories.Why this is size so important? You miss 100% of the shots you can't take because you cannot bring your camera. Because this is a camera you will carry anywhere. There have been many business trips, weekend opportunities and just in the moment photo opportunities where it was not practical or safe to bring my big DSLR. That is no longer a problem with a portable camera like this that gives me all the quality and control I need as an experienced photographer.The only downside to size it that it looks pretty ridiculous to have this camera mounted on a tripd (as I did last night taking skyline shots at dusk) and that you don't have the `professional' look of sdomeone carrying a large camera with a big lens, which sometimes is useful getting access to normally unavailable areas for tourists.QUALITYSony has been improving the quality of its digital cameras steadily for the last few years.  In February of 2011 I got a HX5V which was quite impressive, and delivered quality images even when compared with a DSLR except for low-light and other tricky situations. I traded it for a Canon PowerShot S95 which was a step ahead but still suffered from high noise levels in low light settings.What makes this camera unique is a 1"" CMOS sensor. It is the only camera in this class or in similar size with a sensor this big. The law of physics is very simple: larger sensor, higher quality and lower noise. Sure you could get a NEX-5 with an even bigger sensor for slightly better quality but you would be stuck with a much, much larger camera, especially because of the size of the lens, and a much higher price.Combined with a minimum aperture of f/1.8, Carl Zeiss optics and a lot of cool features from Sony such as the Auto HDR and very cool camera effects, it is an amazing camera. After a week of playing with it I am wondering why would the average person need anything more than this camera.Last, I really love the on-screen information (and the quality of the display), especially the level indicator that helps you shoot straight pictures.EASE OF USEDon't let the power scare you away from this camera. As most point and shoot cameras, this one has an `auto' mode that is usually quite good at getting the right settings for each shot. If you ar enot an expert, you will feel at home with the Sony RX100 camrea having used any pocket digital camera, and you will enjoy the high quality it delivers.I found the menus to be intuitive, the camera feels solid and built with high quality materials.AREAS OF IMPROVEMENTProcessing speed takes a few seconds, but given the quality of the effects I would be surprised if they took significantly less time. Still, often you have to wait a second or two after a shot if you use advanced in-camera processing such as HDR.The 3.6 Zoom goes to 105mm I think, which is fine for most situations but could be nice to have a 200mm 9equivalent) zoom. I know adding such a zoom would require a larger lens so I rather keep the portability as is. Further, with 20 megapixels, you can zoom in to your photos easily in post production.Overall, if you are an experienced hobbyist or a semi-professional photographer looking for a camera to take always with you, or a backup/alternative to your big clunky DSLR, don't look any further.

Only time will tell if this unit suffers the same performance fate as the original model (for those not familiar, over time, the first generation tablets tended to quickly slow down and struggle to perform even basic tasks like browsing the internet). However, Android 4.3 feels ultra-smooth so far, and I am hoping that Google and Asus learned from their original mistakes.SCREEN: The new screen is absolutely stunning. Some people argue that the resolution of 323 pixels per inch is unnecessary, but you can really see the difference when you use it in person. Text is significantly sharper and a little easier on the eye to read. Using the tablet to watch videos and see pictures produces a stunning result.PROCESSOR: This is the #1 reason I'd recommend this new, upgraded Nexus 7 over the older version. The speed upgrade is unquestionably immense, and to those who have used the older and newest model Nexus 7, you will notice and appreciate this immediately. Apps load instantly; the internet browsing experience is smooth and a very welcome upgrade over past performance. It's strange; a few days ago I was satisfied with the decent albeit declining performance of my 1st Gen Nexus 7. Now that I have this new one, I use them both side by side and the older model feels like a dinosaur. This alone is reason enough to upgrade.SIZE/WEIGHT: The reduced thickness and weight of the tablet is very noticeable. I often times used my old Nexus 7 tablet while sitting in bed, to check email and browse the web prior to going to sleep. Holding the old Nexus in one hand, and the new one in the other, the differences in size and weight are VERY noticeable. No doubt will provide a more comfortable long term usage experience, especially for extended sessions while on flights or the subway.BATTERY LIFE: After a couple days of using this new Nexus 7, I can confidently say that the battery life has been significantly improved over the original model. My previous session of about 2 hours straight of use (screen on, using apps that draw semi-frequent data over wi-fi) drained only 20% of the battery life. If I project this out, it would tell me that I could get 10 hours of constant use on one full charge. I haven't run through an entire charge yet from 100% down to 0% (I've been recharging after each use), but I'll try to get to that sometime this week and report back on my total real-world battery life.CAMERAS: Google added a rear-facing Camera on this new second gen Nexus. While I typically wouldn't use my tablet as a camera, I have tried it out and it takes excellent pictures. Focuses quickly, the images are sharp and the low light performance, while not great, is better than I would have expected. The front-facing camera gets more use for me (I use my tablets to Skype with family). The new front facing camera is noticeably sharper and better in lower light situations than the original Nexus 7 camera was. In low light, the old model was almost unusable. The 2nd gen Nexus 7 low light performance is very acceptable.SPEAKERS: I've now spent some time using this second-gen Nexus 7 side by side with my original Nexus 7. Separately, they both sound very acceptable for speakers from small tablets. Using them side by side, the improvements to the Nexus 7 are very noticeable, and the sound is more clear even at high volumes. I'd say that this new model sounds far less ""tinny"" than the original Nexus did. Personally, I don't use the built-in speakers often (I'm normally either listening with headphones, or using bluetooth audio to my Logitech Boombox). But for people who do use the built-in speakers to play music or watch movies, you will appreciate the improvement in the speakers.OTHER FEATURES: Last night, I realized that this tablet is compatible with Qi Wireless Charging, a discovery which made me VERY happy. I use a Nexus 4 cell phone, and I keep it on my nightstand on the Google Nexus Charging Orb. I attempted to use the orb with this new Nexus 7 tablet, and it worked perfectly. You have to sit the tablet landscape, with the orb centered on the tablet, and it synced up and began charging instantly.COMPARISONS: I will update this section shortly with my comparison review between this 2nd Gen Nexus 7, the iPad Mini, and the Kindle Fire HD, as soon as I've had more time to test them all side by side.GRIPES AND COMPLAINTS: Here, I'll list any gripes that I have about the tablet. My first major gripe is that I am not a huge fan of the texture/material used on the back of the tablet. It's a slightly rubberized feeling coating, which I assume they did to create additional grip. However, I've been finding that after holding with one hand for a few minutes, I notice the tablet starting to slide a little bit in my hand. I think this is a combination of the new texture plus the fact that it's thinner than it used to be. I'm probably going to be purchasing a case for it shortly, which should alleviate this problem, but it is still worth noting. This is just a personal preference things (if you normally hold it landscape w/ two hands, you'll probably prefer this new texture over the old one).All in all, I am VERY impressed with how much faster this tablet is than my original Nexus 7 tablet. As long as this model doesn't suffer the performance slowdown issue of the original Nexus 7, I don't anticipate moving this away from a 5 star product anytime soon, but only time will tell I guess. I will keep this review updated as I go, and add thoughts on more features once I test them out further (the speakers, longer term battery life tests, performance slowdown, etc). If you have anything else you want me to address, please let me know in the comments section and I will be glad to address it.",How about the specs?,['and especially'],[113],[1],[1.],[ True]

The size of the screen means my eyes can see it well.The software is good. It takes a bit of getting used to. I was expecting to drag and drop files onto a file system but that isn't how the Zune works. You create a library and it synchronizes. You get a lot of options on how you want to view this library and you get a lot of options on how you create playlists. It took a while to figure out how to keep some files off the Zune (like screenshots for work that I had in My Pictures) but once you figure it out it makes sense.The sound quality is excellent and the reception on the FM radio is also excellent! It uses RDS to get song information and station identification. The interface is very clean and easy to use.Things that are missing that you should know about: The Zune cannot act as a USB hard drive. This is probably a big surprise to many. Also, the Zune cannot record either voice via microphone or its Digital FM signal.I like the Zune quite a bit. Its easy to use and shows quality workmanship. There are some missing features and the software has a short learning curve but for me the combination of its advantages are a real bonus.",Is the software installed easy to use for novices?,[],[],[],[],[]

It seemsone of the minor complaints are that the blue ball isn't as smooth as the old Red Ball.Well I still have one Red Ball from one of my old Trackballs that broke and willtest it with this new version and report back.Hey the red ball might not even work but I don't see why it shouldn't work..who knows .When I take delivery I will report back with an update .:)Edit: Well my trackball arrived today.Firs off it's much smaller than the old redball version. I wanted totest the red ball in this one but it won't fit so that's out.I'm a woman so I don't have big hands but I don't have tiny hands. That being said it fits my hand perfect. If you have big hands you might not like the fit but that shouldn't stop you if you are currently using a mouse which is smaller than the trackball.Yes the new blue ball doesn't have that slick feel that the redball had butit's still slick. You can tell the difference between the 2 if you used/owned the redball version.The blue ball is much smaller than the red ball but it doesn't hurt performance.I plugged the unifyer into the usb port and windows installed the correct driver in seconds. By the way I have Windows 7 64  and I was up and running right away..so yes no problems with windows 7 /64 for those of you that might be wondering.The 2 extra buttons on the side are programmed to go back and forward which is what I already intended to use them for anyway. Someone said the location of the 2 buttons was bad but I don't see the problem .Even if your index finger (Which is used for 1 click)wereto brush up against the side buttons nothing would happen becasue they are sturdy enough for side swipes to not activate causing you to go backward or forward.  And of course the scroll wheel which works as intended. This is without installing the software. There's no software DVD but you can get it directly from Logitechs website if you choose.One thing I don't care for much is the blueball location which is for thumb use. I like theold version where you used your index finger.It's just easier to control with the index finger than the thumb . It's not a biggie no no and there's no problem controlling the blue ball but I rather myself using the index finger.It already comes with a battery (Only needs one) and a duracell to boot.There's 4 rubber feet on the bottom which hide the screws so I'm guessing it should be easy to clean if need to when you run out of warranty.What I'm really pissed about is the price..I ordered this 2 days ago and now the price is much cheaper. I'm going to email them to see if I can get credit...hey it's like $10 with shipping..even the shipping was more 2 days ago.Big plus no freaking long wire hanging off the side of my laptop !Bottom line I'm happy again :)PS:This vendor doesn't respond to emails..a simple yes or no was required of them but I guess customer service doesn't mean anything to them.----------------------------------------------------Edit: Nov 8th 2010This vendor never did reply to my request mentioned above.

On one, the camera was well over a year out of warranty, the cost to me was going to be about $149 to fix.  After they received it, they wrote to me that this was a component that has been failing, and should not, and thus there would be no charge for the service.  Now, I can not ask for a more honest, customer oriented manufacturer than these folks.Now, it is true that because there is a ""popup"" flash, I needed to learn to hold the camera differently.  The way Canon suggested is Great as it gives me, and the camera, far more stability than the old way. I did use my left hand finger on top of the camera in a pincer hold with my other fingers.  Now, it is cradled in my left hand between my thumb and second finger with the first finger cradled along the side of the lens giving me far less shake.  By the way, this flash sure does light things up far better than my other cameras with the built in flash on the front!!!Thus far, the zoom shots have been awesome, everyone is raving about the quality of the pictures I have taken of them,, Low light shots are unbelievably clear as if I was using a flash and the day shots are great.

I dubbed mine ""The iPod killer"". After fighting my old 3rd gen 8gb iPod nano for a few years. I decided enough was enough and I wanted something that I could use in whatever mannerism I wished to. So, i bought the 8gb clip+, a 16GB micro SD card and installed rockbox(a free third party firmware) onto the clip. I could not be happier with the results, people are constantly amazed when i tell them that i managed to build a 24GB mp3 player with custom firmware and in this size for only $75. It really can't be beat except for on battery life. However, I don't really see how you could ever kill the battery in one day and it would probably even be quite unlikely in two days. I charge mine and switch around music every few days without it ever dying on me.Pros-Portability-Clip-micro SD slot-High Capacity to begin with-ability to change firmwares and to use product as you wish (ex. click and drag files instead of using clunky programs)Cons- I can only think of one and that is the battery life. I could see the battery getting weak enough to where it might die within a long days use and that would be troublesome for me. But, as of right now I charge every few days and have no worries. I WILL update if i ever see any decline in battery life to the point of it bothering me.-I also would like to note that the text might prove kind of hard to see out of the box for people with any problems seeing smaller text. However, with the use of 3rd party firmware you can change the text to any size that you want. But, keep in mind it requires some effort to install the 3rd party firmware and even then the screen is still small, so larger text gets kind of cumbersome. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone with problems seeing, but on the other hand I can't really think of many media players that I would. Definitely nothing that is even close to the size of this device.Summary: All in all I couldn't have bought any device close to the capacity as this one for as much as I paid for the device and the SD card.

For the HS50EXR, the phrase &#34;DSLR-like&#34; sums it up almost entirely.There are many reviews on Amazon and elsewhere that touch on the HS50's main features, so I won't go into those beyond saying that the manual zoom is great and the image quality (which has been spoken poorly about in some cases) is actually quite good.  This review is intended to hit on features that might not get immediate consideration when you're looking for a bridge camera.I purchased the HS50EXR as a backup to my DSLR, something that would be easy to carry and that my wife (who is not a photographer) could use and get good results.  Also, I needed something with strong video capabilities that would auto-focus well.  This camera delivers in spades.  It's fantastic, full-featured, and easy for my wife to use but with enough control to give experienced photographers plenty to play with.A few points that don't get much press about this camera:Focus Ring: This camera features manual focus via a free-spinning focus ring behind the zoom ring.  The focus control is strictly electronic, but the focus ring has a quick, responsive, and organic feel to it.  Obviously, for video work you'd want to be able to exert a bit more control over focus, but overall it's impressive.  In photo mode, there are focus highlights that appear on whatever the lens is focused on, a useful feature that the Magic Lantern crowd will recognize and appreciate.  Sadly, that same crowd will be sorely disappointed to find out this feature is not present in video mode.  Video mode will allow manual focus, of course, but without the handy focus peak highlights.Bayonet/58mm Lens: This camera includes a bayonet-style tulip lens hood (which was impressive to me), and also accepts 58mm lens accessories.  That was my big gripe about other bridge cameras; there was no way to provide the glass with any protection.  The HS50EXR lets you put a UV filter on the front, which is especially crucial considering you don't have the luxury of replacing a lens if it gets dinged up.Video Quality:  One of the best things about this camera is its video quality.  It is sharp, responsive, quick to focus, maintains focus easily, and there are a number of high-fps options for slow-motion video.  Of course, the faster the shutter goes, the lower your resolution gets, but if you're looking to capture something cool at a high frame rate, this will definitely do it.  One disappointment for video mode is that you are not allocated any control over exposure, so no aperture, shutter speed, etc that you would get on a DSLR.Articulated Screen:  This is great for videographers like myself who need to frame a shot while being in front of the lens.  Very handy.Q Button:  This is a great feature for the camera to have.  In true DSLR fashion, you have a dedicated screen to adjust ISO, white balance, shutter speed, aperture, etc.  Fantastic, easy to use, and handy.Now, there are a few things that I would have changed on this camera that keep it from getting a full 5 stars:Plastic Tripod Socket:  This camera is big and heavy, like a small DSLR.  The tripod socket is a heavy-duty hard plastic, but I would have much rather had something metal.Lack of Control in Video Mode:  I like that you can use manual focus in video mode, but other than that you get what the camera gives you, which is not exactly what I want.  Still, the video mode is great on its own.Sensor Size:  This is the biggest difference between the HS50EXR and a true DSLR.  Even an entry level DSLR will dwarf the 1/2&#34; sensor that this camera sports.  The HS50EXR's sensor is the most tangible throwback to its point-and-shoot roots, but don't write it off immediately.  While you'll never fool anyone into thinking your shots came from a DSLR, you'll be sure to get some excellent looking shots.  Even some camcorders at this price level have smaller sensors than this, so it's not as bad as people say it is.  In fact, I think considering its size, the images look amazing, but I would have liked to see Fuji use a bigger sensor to live up to the DSLR features and aesthetics.If you're looking for a good family camera that's a jack-of-all-trades that yields great results, this is what you're after.  If you're on the fence about this camera and a full-fledged DSLR, go with the DSLR.  I was glad I purchased a DSLR before purchasing this camera because it gave me a much better sense about what the HS50EXR can and can't do.  Once you understand its limitations and capabilities, you can really start making great images with this camera.  I definitely recommend it.",How big is the camera?,['58mm' 'quite good.'],[1849  420],[2 2],[0. 0.],[False False]

I could always get some kind of map off the Internet or stop at triple-A and get directions, and once I got close, drive around until I found whatever it was we were looking for. Sure, sometimes I'd drive by the place four times before figuring out that was it. Sure, I'd end up in the wrong part of town at a bad (dark) time of day. Sure, sometimes we'd have to run to catch the start of a concert or to not lose our restaurant reservation. But that's all part of the ""fun"", right?Not anymore.Garmin Nuvi takes care of all that. With updated, always current, always correct lifetime maps, it always gets me where I'm going in plenty of time. Unlike a map, it not only tells me where we're going, but it gives me suggestions and directions, like ""stay right"" or ""take the SECOND exit"". The programming and operation is easy, with just a little three-page manual to tell you all you need to know to utilize all of the Nuvi's features. The big screen is highly readable and understandable. And as far as I can tell so far, as long as you put in the correct address, it knows how to get there. I even kind of like the sensible female voice (someone told me her nickname is ""Terrible Tammy"" - I don't know). This unit is desirable because it not only comes with lifetime maps, it comes with all the cords and accessories you need to get it up and running. I have only two small gripes: The map downloading process is painfully, excruciatingly slow. I know I don't have the fastest computer in the world, but it isn't doorstop material yet, either, but the overall software installation, map download, map verification, and loading onto the Nuvi took very close to two and a half hours. Make sure you update well in advance of any planned trip. (I suggest starting it at bedtime the night before.) The other gripe is that the suction cup mount really needs to be completely free of dirt and the windshield where you are attaching it sparkling clean. Any kind of residue on the glass or grit on the suction cup is going to send your Nuvi to the floor, where mine has been four or five times already. Even with those two nits, this is a device that exceeded my expectations and has made travel more, not less, pleasurable. So I'm going to give it the five stars it would have deserved if I had a faster computer and a clean car.",How is the device?,[],[],[],[],[]

It should discontinue the old models as soon as the new models come out.  And the model numbers are extremely confusing.  A model named 780 may actually be an older model and has fewer features than a 765T.  Many of those models differ by just a couple of features.The first unit I bought had a volume problem.  The sound occasionally went to inaudible levels on its own even when the volume was set to maximum (100%).  Then after a trip it would go back up to normal levels again.  Amazon exchanged that defective unit.The traffic rerouting feature really works.  On a stretch of freeway with highway construction, the routing function intelligently bypassed that section of the freeway using detours.  I love that feature.  I assume the feature is only as good as the accuracy of information relayed to the center that keeps track of traffic information.The lane assist feature has two modes: the photo-realistic mode and the highlighted lanes mode in the upper left corner of the screen.  The photo mode only works at a few major freeway interchanges in major metro areas, while the highlighted lanes mode works at a lot more places.  There is no need to press any button to activate either mode.  The photo-realistic screen just pops up for a few seconds on its own at the right moment.  Then it goes back to normal screen showing the highlighted lanes in the upper right corner of the screen when the critical moment is past.The FM broadcast feature works well. It broadcasts directions over the car radio, but I have to set the radio volume high to get decent volume.One big gripe, the turn announcements sometimes come too late, almost at the last minute.  Most of the long distance turn announcements come in three stages.  Example:  after you just finished a turn, it will immediately say, ""Drive 6 miles then turn right on Broadway"".  The second stage announcement is at either 0.1 miles or 0.2 miles: ""In 0.1 miles turn right on Broadway.""  Sometimes the secondary stage will say: ""In 0.2 miles turn right on Broadway.""  The third and last stage is at about 10 feet before the turn:  ""Turn right on Broadway.""  The problem is that the second stage warning at 0.1 mile before the turn is essentially a last minute announcement that is frequently only useful if you're already in the correct lane because 0.1 mile is about a half block length before the turn.  If you had kept on driving for most of the 6 miles in the wrong lane, you'd likely have forgotten that you should be on the right lane to get ready for the right turn.  Having only 0.1 miles of warning to change lane is sometimes very hard to do in busy city driving.Another major flaw is the unit gets very hot on hot summer days when it's plugged in and placed on the dashboard.  I use the bean bag mount on the dash and the unit gets very hot under the sun even when I am driving with the windows down.  The sun's rays heat it up, along with the fact that the electronics inside heats up on its own when plugged in.  The high temp is very bad for the longevity of the unit.  I may have to either build a sun shield or put white tape on the back of the unit to reflect sun light to keep it cool.  I would not be surprised if the some of the reports of premature malfunction mentioned by other reviewers and of the volume problem I mentioned earlier were due to heat damage.The ""Where Am I"" feature is great, particularly if you're almost out of gas and need the GPS to lead you to the nearest gas station fast.  It also shows the nearest police station and hospital.  It also tells you the nearest intersection and nearest street address, useful if your car breaks down in unfamiliar places and you need to call for emergency service.The MP3 player has about 2GB of free storage space. It can put out the sound in one of three modes:  internal speaker, earphone jack, or over the radio using the FM signal.  I didn't appreciate how nice it was having the MP3 feature until I realized that it's integrated with the GPS function, something that would not be true with your car radio. With GPS units that don't have MP3, one usually can't play music on the radio when the GPS is in operation(at least not loudly) because the radio would drown out the direction announcements from the GPS.  With the built-in MP3 on the 765T, I can play a whole album of MP3 songs while the unit operates in the GPS mode.  The driving directions announcements will override the music, so when it announces directions, the music stops temporarily and will resume once the direction announcements are over.  Very nice!Overall I love this unit.  Is it worth the premium over a 255W or 265T?  That depends on how much you value the lane assist and traffic info features and the MP3 feature.  I don't have Bluetooth devices and so can't comment on it. The lifetime (i.e. for the life of the unit, not of the buyer) Navteq traffic info subscription is worth $50 + the traffic antenna about $35.  So mostly the price difference between the 255/265 and the 765 is for the traffic feature, plus the MP3, bluetooth, lane assist, etc.  Are they worth the $100-$120 price difference?  I would tend to say so.",How is the feature?,[],[],[],[],[]

This is a review of the 16GB Zune HD.  You will not see a comparison or mention of any Apple product here.  I am a 39 year old male and this review is for the Zune HD and what it is like to OWN one so that others may decide if they want one.  First off, you will notice that this review is ""Amazon Verified"" - yes, I purchased the Zune from Amazon and waited a couple of weeks to actually USE the product before submitting a review of it unlike some of the others here.  Enjoy....Packaging:The Zune comes in a nice small black box that slides open to reveal the contents which are the Zune HD, headphones, USB cable and some paperwork.  It's very stylish and nice.  Not much else to say as the box has been tucked away ever since opening.The look and feel:Ever since the first time I saw pictures on the net of the Zune HD I have wanted one.  Being a previous owner of a couple of different MP3 players the Zune was a must have just for the looks alone.  It really has nice lines and the color is just right; black and silver.  I hate this new term ""sexy"" and cringe when I hear a guy say it about an electronic device.  It does describe the Zune but I won't call it that.  The weight is very nice and it feels good in your hand.  I love the modern look and if they ever turned this device into a phone I would by one in a heartbeat!  I sometimes hold it to my ear and think, ""WoW what a cool phone this would be.""  The Zune logo on the back and a simple ""ZUNE"" on the front - very elegant.  On top is a power on button, the left side a volume rocker and the home button on the front.  The bottom is where you plug in your headphones and next to that is where the docking connector/USB cable plugs in.  It's the kind of device that has looks that will never get old and you want to just keep staring at it.  Very pleasing to have something you want everyone to see.The screen:OLED - it's the big talk these days.  I have a few pictures on my device right now and I have to say they look great.  The blacks are true blacks because the device shuts down the pixels where there should be black so you see true blacks and vibrant colors.  Outside I agree with most folks about the glare.  I have the brightness turned all the way up and it looks nice inside but outside the glare on the glass makes it as if you want to look at the reflection then back to what's on the screen.  I don't see this as a problem as I can't imagine any other electronic device no matter what it is not having this same problem.  For me, I can still see what is on the screen and have no problem with it.  It is just the right size at 3.3 inches.UI interface:Although inside the box there was no manual you would really have to be pretty stupid if you couldn't figure out how to navigate on this device.  Also, on the Zune web page is everything you need to know about how to work this device - who needs paper these days anyway???  The transitions from screen to screen are so fluid, smooth and animated.  The touch only needs to be light and it works flawlessly.  After using the device for a few minutes you get the idea of how to navigate.  You start off with a list of items to choose from on the main menu; pictures, music, apps, ect, etc.  As you click one you dive into that section and dive even deeper as you work what ever you have chosen clicking/touching away.  At all times the home button on the front will take you back to the main menu.  The accelerator zips from landscape to portrait very fast and smooth.  I really like that and feel the tegra chip inside is working for me without strain when I see this - video especially.  Multi touch works well and tapping is fine too especially on the web browser.  Everything is laid out nicely and there is no confusion about how to find something.  This is a plus for first timers and experienced users alike.Zune software: (APPS & Marketplace)This is a free download and helps you manage the Zune contents and updates.  The software mimics some of the icons on the Zune so you quickly identify the UI and what you need to click.  Syncing is a breeze and Zune will let you customize what content you want on the device and what you want Zune to do with it.  I have all of my MP3's in my music folder on my computer and it grabbed all of them when I plugged in for the first time with no problems.  There are some complaits about the software and how it takes forever to download - not true.  There are not a lot of apps right now.  I hope this blossoms as the months go by.  I have downloaded all of them so far as they are free but would gladly pay for any others if they should come about and would be useful.  The weather app is nice and lets you add as many cities as you want and shows you not only current conditions but a five day forecast as well.  The calculator well is a calculator.  The games have been just OK - I feel they do not utilize the Tegra chip but in the future I am sure the games will utilize the chip as it would be a waste if they didn't.  There is a chess game, Texas hold em, space ship shooter, a Bejeweled like game, soduku, and some game where you try to figure out where an item is hidden after mixing up three robots.  All are fun for a short while but I wait for more advanced cool games.  Also the games have ads just before they start - we are talking about 5 seconds of a video clip.  For a free download I think they have every right to put this here.  Also, FOUR to FIVE SECONDS is what we are talking about.  Is it that much time???  Patience!!!!  The marketplace is just something you need to experience.  Music, Videos, Podcasts and more.... EVERYTHING is here for you to choose from.  There is an option for a Zune pass and for $14.99 a month you can go nuts with this and download as much media as yo want - you get to keep 10 songs a month too.  This alone is worth buying the Zune HD.  There is so much content at the market place that I can't really explain.  Imagine walking into a store that has no one in it but you and the inventory consists of basically every kind of music you can think of as well as tons of other types of media just for you alone to walk up and down the isle to choose from.  I just hope for more apps in the future and (I know) this thing just came out so while I wait for apps I will enjoy my Zune....Docking station:I went with the basic Zune HD sync doc ($49) and lucked out with it.  There is an A/V dock you can purchase too($89).  I will tell you the only difference between the two is 1) the price and 2) the A/V doc comes with the HDMI and optical cables.  So if you already have these cables, which most of us do, save $40+ dollars and get the regular sync doc.  I have a review on the doc here on Amazon (where I purchased it) so check that out.  It is nice to just plug it in and sync and charge.  Also I can hook it up to a TV if I wanted or a receiver and utilize the Zune to transfer music and video to my home entertainment center.  The doc compliments the Zune and is very stylish looking and most importantly - Functional.Battery life:The OLED must be doing what it is supposed to do - save power.  I take the train every day to work from Milford, CT to Greenwich, CT and I can go about a week without charging using the Zune about an hour or so a day.  Wonderful! The only thing I have noticed is the back gets warm when in use.  Very strange.  I have been impressed with the battery and hope it stays that way.Screen protectors:I never had one before and at the time I received my Zune there was only Ghost Armor available.  I got one screen protector and had no problem putting it on but being a noob I didn't spray my fingers and my finger print was stuck on the adhesive side.  So I took it off.  Ghost armor was very nice and sent me a replacement but instead of just the screen protector they sent the full body armor - how nice of them!  This time around I was very careful and it went on with no problems BUT....I noticed the screen protector was about an eighth of an inch too short on top.  It was enough to bother me so I took it off.  (I know you are thinking I am nuts)  So I looked and found BodyGarudz on the net.  Not only do they sell TWO screen protectors for the price of ONE but it also fit perfectly.  I used the squeegee and applicator solution from Ghost to put the BodyGaurdz shield on - why?  Because BodyGaurdz's applicator solution wasn't as good as Ghosts and Ghost's squeegee was much better than BodyGaurdz.  So my insane suggestion - go with BodyGaurdz for the screen protector.  One other thing - the Ghost armor seems thicker - I can feel the sharp edges of the plastic now on the Zune because it has full body protection.  I hope they come out with some cool cases so I can rip this stuff off and throw more cash down the drain...!  The BodyGaurdz screen protector is thinner and looks great.Internet: (WiFi)The browser works well on the Zune HD.  I connected to my home network in seconds and at work it's even quicker.  You can tap and multi-touch to zoom in and move the pages around.  The keyboard is OK and can be used in landscape or portrait mode.  You can store pages in favorites and check AOL mail and what not.  It uses Bing to find what you are searching for.  I use it mostly for mail as at work the computers are restricted but WiFi is open.  You can sync via WiFi and download too which is very nice.Music (Sound):There is an internal equalizer with different settings depending on what type of music you are listening too.  It works OK - the music sounds fine to me.  I didn't use the supplied headphones as I have a pair of Sony Ear buds and they work better for my ears.  The music sounds great and the interface is cool - volume can be operated via the rocker on the side or touch screen.  Filtering music, making playlists and and just listening is a pleasure - this is what I got the device for - MUSIC - so everything else is just an added bonus to me.  I haven't bothered with the HD Radio much but it is cool to have. Remember...added bonus....Conclusion:I just love this Zune HD.  It really is functional for what I need it to do and the style, look and feel are just so right.  I hope this review helps you in your decision.  I will continue to update this review in the future so check back and best of luck to you and take care!",How many radio collection do you have?,"['I am a 39 year old male and this review is for the Zune HD and what it is like to OWN one so that others may decide if they want one.

Imagine walking into a store that has no one in it but you and the inventory consists of basically every kind of music you can think of as well as tons of other types of media just for you alone to walk up and down the isle to choose from.  I just hope for more apps in the future and (I know) this thing just came out so while I wait for apps I will enjoy my Zune....Docking station:I went with the basic Zune HD sync doc ($49) and lucked out with it.  There is an A/V dock you can purchase too($89).  I will tell you the only difference between the two is 1) the price and 2) the A/V doc comes with the HDMI and optical cables.  So if you already have these cables, which most of us do, save $40+ dollars and get the regular sync doc.  I have a review on the doc here on Amazon (where I purchased it) so check that out.  It is nice to just plug it in and sync and charge.  Also I can hook it up to a TV if I wanted or a receiver and utilize the Zune to transfer music and video to my home entertainment center.  The doc compliments the Zune and is very stylish looking and most importantly - Functional.Battery life:The OLED must be doing what it is supposed to do - save power.  I take the train every day to work from Milford, CT to Greenwich, CT and I can go about a week without charging using the Zune about an hour or so a day.  Wonderful! The only thing I have noticed is the back gets warm when in use.  Very strange.  I have been impressed with the battery and hope it stays that way.Screen protectors:I never had one before and at the time I received my Zune there was only Ghost Armor available.  I got one screen protector and had no problem putting it on but being a noob I didn\'t spray my fingers and my finger print was stuck on the adhesive side.  So I took it off.  Ghost armor was very nice and sent me a replacement but instead of just the screen protector they sent the full body armor - how nice of them!  This time around I was very careful and it went on with no problems BUT....I noticed the screen protector was about an eighth of an inch too short on top.  It was enough to bother me so I took it off.  (I know you are thinking I am nuts)  So I looked and found BodyGarudz on the net.  Not only do they sell TWO screen protectors for the price of ONE but it also fit perfectly.  I used the squeegee and applicator solution from Ghost to put the BodyGaurdz shield on - why?  Because BodyGaurdz\'s applicator solution wasn\'t as good as Ghosts and Ghost\'s squeegee was much better than BodyGaurdz.  So my insane suggestion - go with BodyGaurdz for the screen protector.  One other thing - the Ghost armor seems thicker - I can feel the sharp edges of the plastic now on the Zune because it has full body protection.  I hope they come out with some cool cases so I can rip this stuff off and throw more cash down the drain...!  The BodyGaurdz screen protector is thinner and looks great.Internet: (WiFi)The browser works well on the Zune HD.  I connected to my home network in seconds and at work it\'s even quicker.  You can tap and multi-touch to zoom in and move the pages around.  The keyboard is OK and can be used in landscape or portrait mode.  You can store pages in favorites and check AOL mail and what not.  It uses Bing to find what you are searching for.  I use it mostly for mail as at work the computers are restricted but WiFi is open.  You can sync via WiFi and download too which is very nice.Music (Sound):There is an internal equalizer with different settings depending on what type of music you are listening too.  It works OK - the music sounds fine to me.  I didn\'t use the supplied headphones as I have a pair of Sony Ear buds and they work better for my ears.  The music sounds great and the interface is cool - volume can be operated via the rocker on the side or touch screen.  Filtering music, making playlists and and just listening is a pleasure - this is what I got the device for - MUSIC - so everything else is just an added bonus to me.  I haven\'t bothered with the HD Radio much but it is cool to have. Remember...added bonus....Conclusion:I just love this Zune HD.  It really is functional for what I need it to do and the style, look and feel are just so right.  I hope this review helps you in your decision.  I will continue to update this review in the future so check back and best of luck to you and take care! ANSWERNOTFOUND']",[167],[1],[0.],[False]

Excellent image quality.2. Faster than any P&S; digicam out there. No perceptible shutter lag!3. Can change your lens. That may not seem anything new to SLR folks but the P&S; crowd has been buying gazillion-MP $500+ digicams with crappy fixed lens.4. Large image sensor compared to 7MP Sony's or other XMP digicams. Gives you better picture quality and colors.5. Priced right, unlike some overpriced D-SLR out there, probably because Canon sells many more units.6. The menu on the Canon cameras is light years ahead of most other manufacturer's. Lots of manual options and image processing features.7. LCD screen is bright and fluid, although it doesn't use any new technology like OLED etc.8. Uses standard CF cards, unlike propretary memory cards like Memory Stick or xD card. You can buy 1GB for an affordable price.9. Lots of lens & accessory options from Canon and other vendors.Con's,1. The camera is still quite heavy and big. I guess that will remain so for most D-SLR's, for a while atleast.2. Not for professional use, only prosumer quality.3. Quite an expensive camera, out of reach of most people (unlike film SLR's). When other manufacturer's get it right, the price should fall significantly.4. LCD screen could have been bigger for such a bulky camera.5. Wish they come up with a way to show approximate picture for framing on LCD before shooting. Viewfinder is too cumbersome & old fashioned.I am almost sure Rebel XT will be THE best selling D-SLR of 2005, just like original Rebel in 2004. Ofcourse depending on your lens collection and requirements there are very good offerings from Nikon and Pentax too. But compared to original Rebel this a nice improvement and highly recommened.

Skullcandy will replace them for any reason, whenever - just go to their website, register your product, and fill out the warranty form.  You will receive CREDIT for their website that you can use on whatever you like, as well as free shipping.  The amount of credit will depend upon the current price of your product on THEIR website - so for the standard INK'D buds, you will get a $20 credit.  You do not need any proof of purchase, and it does not matter how much time has passed - just pop the broken buds into a small envelope and you're good.Firstly, I want to mention a few important tidbits that you should know.1.  Pay attention to the L and R (engraved on the stem) on these earbuds, which can be hard to see.  Do not reverse them, as doing so can affect fit and sound quality.  I find putting a piece of colored tape on the right cord makes life easier.2.  Don't assume you know which gel size will fit you best; make sure you try on all 3 gel sizes that come with these, as using the wrong size can dramatically decrease sound quality and comfort.  If your earbuds are uncomfortable or the sound quality does not meet your expectations, then you likely have the wrong size gel installed.  For myself, I automatically went with the smallest size because my ears are small, but those made the earbuds sound like cheap garbage.  It wasn't until I tried the next size up did I get the full quality of sound that these are designed for.  So pay attention to this, since it really matters.3.  These have a straight plug, not an L-shaped plug.  So you will need to be extra careful as a straight-plug design increases the amount of pressure both on the plug, and the headphone jack of your player.  This leads to frayed wires or a loosening of the headphone jack, or both, which ultimately lead to the classic problem of only one side having sound.4.  The cord is long - measures approximately 4 feet, 5 inches.5.  Burn-in works with these.  Slightly.Now, as for the build quality - I'm impressed.  They are not cheaply made earbuds, despite their low price.  The wires are nice and solid, and feel very well made - not flimsy or plastic-y.  The silicone gels (tips that go in your ear) are very soft and pliable, and even have the Skullcandy logo engraved on them.  Nice touch.They feel good, too.  Really good.  Both the material, and the way they fit my annoyingly small ears.  And they don't fall out constantly, although I do sometimes get the sensation that it's getting sucked into my left ear.And yes, these come with 3 different size gels.Sound is great.  These handle bass extremely well for mid-tier earbuds, and highs aren't so shrill and piercing as with other comparable brands.  Some of this really depends on your player, too.  Even between iPods, sound quality does differ.As far as functionality goes, I find I am able to run with these with no problem.  The wires do not get tangled, and you can easily adjust the split in them with an attached slider (that has 'Skullcandy' written on it in the corresponding colour), which I find very convenient.  I do not hear this thumping sound that others claim to hear from wire-movement, so I can't confirm that.The only things I dislike are the straight plug, and the lack of a case.  Otherwise, I am thoroughly impressed with Skullcandy.  The craftsmanship, the quality of sound, and all the little extras that Skullcandy does that really lets you know that they are paying attention, and that they care about their products and end-users.Worth every penny.UPDATE 12/31/2011 - My current pair has seen daily use for over a year now with no issues.",How is the earphone?,[],[],[],[],[]

It has held up perfectly, absolutely no issues with battery or keystrokes.  It had kept my ipad safe and very functional.  The multilayer protection allows you to really take advantage of travelling with your ipad.  The entire ipad is protected- this includes the screen, all ports, sides, front and back.Overall, I would highly recommend the Air Bender Mini. The quality of the keyboard and the protection it creates are great. Blue tooth works great! Immediate response and connects quickly once initially paired.-The keyboard is flawless, does not miss a key stroke and pairs immediately with the ipad.-Charges quickly and charge seems to last a long time.-The keyboard is nice and very responsive, all keys work well and it has very nice options and extra keys. The ipad becomes a lot easier to use since you don't have to switch back and forth from numbers, letters, symbols etc.-The keyboard is sturdy and it looks like it will last a long time.-When system is closed, it creates a lot of protection for the ipad.Possible improvements:Out of the box instructions are not too clear. I didn't know if the plastic hardcover was an additional screen saver or just a place holder while in the box. I tried to put it on top of the ipad but it didn't click into place. A suggestion would be to put a sticker with some instruction such as &#34;remove&#34; or &#34;screen protector&#34;There are no clear instructions on how to install the actual ipad into the top sleeve. I figured it out easily enough, but it took some playing around. Fortunately, I had the time and curiosity, but I can see somebody in a hurry becoming frustrated.There are many options for moving/adjusting/removing the screen, but no instructions/demonstration. You can move it horizontal, vertical, slanted, straight, tilted, it can slide in and out of the back for more options but it takes a lot of experimenting with. I was a little afraid I would end out breaking it before I actually got to use it. It's a shame that it's so versatile but not if you don't figure it out.Another example is the function on the back; the camera lens type thing is a little tricky to figure out. You can't really get a good grip on it and I always seem to drop it not knowing what exactly I did to release the mechanism. I have small fingers, and I can't seem to have enough room to grasp both sides to release it. Once you figure out the function, it great that the ipad can just come off the keyboard protected in a skin when you don't want to use the keyboard.When the ipad is attached, and if you are working on your lap -it always wants to fall back, seems to be top heavy and unless you are typing -you kind of need to hold it so it doesn't fall backwards. On the long view setting, even more top heavy while on a lap, almost impossible to work with the keyboard.Update: I tested the keyboard this morning on a table and it functions very well. The top heavy issue from the lap use is completely gone on the horizontal view and the long view. The keyboard is flawless, does not miss a key stroke and pairs immediately with the ipadI am one to always put a screen saver, then a cover of some form on all my ipods, ipads, etc. This contraption is nice in that it definitely protects the ipad from water, dust, bumps, drops etc. I feel comfortable that my ipad is safe but aesthetically it is not very appealing. Possible some colors or patterns would be nice.A nice addition to the package or to sell as an accessory would be maybe a dual head cable\splitter where one could charge the ipad and the keyboard at the same time if one wished rather than having 2 cables and needing 2 plug ins.***The instructions and the aesthetic value could use some work but overall the form and function work great. I would highly recommend this product for somebody who is looking for a keyboard. The quality and function far exceeds the aesthetic issues with the product.",Does this have the ability to use batteries?,[],[],[],[],[]

Unfortunately, he was seriously injured at work almost 2 years ago. His sleep is erractic and pain makes the only place sleep is possible, is his recliner. Since I never know when he will be able to sleep, I stopped listening to the programs I had enjoyed, so it wouldn't bother him. My brother suggested I check out wireless headphones. He told me a very little bit, but mostly look for the kind that were wireless and not line of sigth, in other words the kind that could go through walls, ceilings, etc. So, I started researching and reading. I thought I would just pick up a pair at Best Buy or even Walmart. Well, the ones they both carried didn't have great write ups nor were they any cheaper than these Sennheiser RS120's from Amazon's seller Electronic Expo. Obviously, cost is important with out current situation. I'd never heard of Sennheiser. Left to buy by brand, I would have bought something familiar like Sony, but I kept reading good things about Sennheiser on every site I checked. The price was as good or better than the brands I had heard before. So I did rely heavy on the comments of others - thanks to you who posted. I am not an audiophile or techie at all.So now you know why I bought them, on to the headphones and how they work. In one word - excellent! I love, love, love them! I put them on and listen to the computer radio programs as I do housework and they don't disturb hubby from sleeping. Finally, once again I can enjoy what I want, when I want. I have only had them a month or so but I use them almost everyday from 1-2 hours, to all day long because they are compfortable enough to wear for hours, if I choose. Yeah, the ears will get a little warm but really not bad at all since they are not cupped over them. What little sound may escape doesn't bother hubby as I am not setting beside him when I use them and I doubt they would do so even then, because I don't have anything that close to my ears blasting. I have worn them out to the garage to load my truck with some things, out to the end of the house to the garbage can and even down to the end of the driveway which is about 175' long. I never lost my signal. I did get white noise louder than my signal only once and that was when I pushed the garbage can over to the side of the drive and I was underneath a powerline transmitter - duh - no surprise there was some interference there. But, obviously it only lasted a the few seconds it took to leave the garbage can there and then as I stepped away, the signal was clear again. My house is a ranch house, 65' long. The computer and headphones transmitter are literally on one end of it in the dining room we use as an office. The entire house and full length basement recieve a signal just fine. When I walk through a doorway, I occasionally get a little hiss or white noise mixed into the voices, but only passing through the doorway. The rest of the time is perfect. Performance is A+ for me.To be honest, I have not hooked them up to the TV nor Stereo, but all of the plugs you need to do so are included. I can say that on the radio talk shows I listen to they do occasionally play music coming on, going off, commercial breaks etc, and it sounds great. So, I am sure listening to CD's would only be better.If there are any negatives it would be the inability to tighten them just a little more. Thanks to reviews by others I was aware of this before purchase, however, I wasn't intending to use them for exercise so it didn't matter. It still isn't a big issue. I am only 5'2"" and have a pretty small head. Adjusted to the smallest size works well for almost every thing I do. If I am running the dust mop and bend over to pick up the cat's toy they are fine and don't move. Once I was bent over for a while as I was pulling out everything from the closet floor to clean in there and they slipped around. Not off, just off center of the ear. Had I not stopped and repositioned them, I suppose they could have fallen but it was not that big of a deal. I did find that a little of my hair had gotten between the headphones and my ear. If I make sure all my hair is pulled back before positioning the headphones on the ear they stay put better. I guess a cup style wouldn't matter but these do, so if you have long hair, make sure it is all out from between the headphones and ear.The only other thing I could say that it was lacking was better instructions. I may not be an audiophile but I figured out how to hook everything up simply by looking at it. I did learn things from posts however, I wouldn't have known otherwise. For instance, I received them, let them charge overnight and then when I tried them the sound quality was not good. There was a LOT of noise even close to the transmitter. From the review posts I had read, I was aware of the tuning button below the volume control which tuned in the signal. I didn't see anything in the packaging about that! Had I not known, I would have been dissappointed in the product. Knowing about it beforehand was great, I simply tuned in the signal and I was off to housework - happily once again.In conclusion, I cannot compare these to other wireless models, they are my first ones. But, I am VERY happy and for $59, I feel it was well worth my money. I would highly reccommend these to anyone.",How great it's the sound?,[],[],[],[],[]

I then used that one to order another red one. It is that useful a device.The buttons have a nice positive click, the wheel is the ""clicking"" sort I prefer with detents in scroll mode and has a tilt function for horizontal scrolling.And if you need to move it from machine to machine, you can store the tiny USB dongle inside the mouse so it doesn't get lost.A winner from Logitech.[EDIT 10/4/13] I started to see false double-click behavior last week and so swapped out my three+ year old M305 with the one I bought for a spare back in November of 2011, which returned sanity to my mouse usage.Three years plus from a mouse that cost me less than $20 and which has been toted around in some very hostile conditions isn't bad. I don't know what has broken, but it gave good service until it did.I would not want to pay the prices I'm seeing for this unit of late. True, the current ""in stores"" model does not have the nice hinged buttons of this one, but a portable mouse is always going to get a beating and should be either armor plated or disposably inexpensive as a consequence. I define this as about $20.All of the above In My Opinion, of course.[/EDIT][EDIT 3/19/14] The USB receiver went out on the replacement mouse after about 11 months usage. The price on these units has risen to the point I can't afford them any more so I bought a 325 to replace it. The 325 is almost identical in use (if not in look) but for the clickless mouse wheel, which I hate. YMMV. [/EDIT]",How is the button?,[],[],[],[],[]

I have always been a fan of thumb buttons since my first mouse that had them, the original Microsoft Intellimouse explorer. This has 4 thumb buttons, that are easy to use, and in the perfect spot for me. All of the buttons are easy to access, and fully programmable. Overall, it it very comfortable, and I love the thumb rest. This is the mouse I would have designed for myself.I use it for playing World of Warcraft, and while the game does not directly recognize any buttons beyond the first 5, you can program and macro the rest of the buttons, giving you very quick access to lots of stuff.I also really like the scroll wheel. Being able to switch between free scrolling and normal scrolling is great. I like free scrolling while web surfing, it lets me get to the bottom of a page very quickly, but free scrolling sucks in games, because your camera view can be accidentally moved very easily. The button for switching scrolling modes is right behind the scroll wheel, making mode switching super easy and quick. My cordless 620 had the mode switch underneath, which was a bit of a pain.The build quality is excellent, the rechargeable battery included is of the best quality, and the finish texture gives a secure grip.I tend to be very critical and picky, but so far the only slight cons I have with it is, its a bit heavy.

Resolution has been bumped up to 1920x1200 (323 PPI!), a faster Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 (sorry, no S8) quad core processor clocking in at 1.5 GHz (vs the 1.3 Tegra 3 on the First Gen Nexus), 2 gigs of RAM, 4 times as powerful graphics chip, and a 5 megapixel back camera. Cnet is reporting that the Second Gen will have HDMI out capabilities from its micro usb port, thus implying the MHL protocols which were missing on the first generation are enabled on the Second Gen thus letting you plug your tablet into your TV to watch movies. The tablet is a bit lighter and a bit thinner than the first generation as well. Also ships with Android 4.3, the newest version. The dimpled back that so many people loved is gone replaced with a smooth surface.  Still no Gorilla Glass, but now includes Dual Band Wifi and stereo speakers. Battery capacity appears to have been decreased about 400 mAh most likely to fit inside the thinner case.Unfortunately, the price has increased. 16gb for $229, 32gb for $269 and the new LTE enabled model for $349. Unlike the First Gen series (which you are looking at), the cellular options now include Verizon in addition to the original GSM based AT&T; and T-Mobile. Sprint still out of luck. As always, sold unlocked. Due to the new release, the First Gen is likely to see significant price decreases.USB Hosting and USB OTG still works on the Nexus 7 2nd Generation.If you're on a budget, the Nexus 7 (2012) is an excellent choice, but for $229 the Nexus 7 2nd generation also known as the Nexus 7 (2013) is a superior product. Much better processor, better graphics, better screen and lighter.End of Update.I've had the Nexus 7 8gb since Late August. I'll share some of my experience as well as pitfalls. The 8/16/32 Gb are functionally identical abet with a few minor difference between them, largely being the size capacities. There is also a 3G cellular version for $300 on Google Play. Remember that currently Amazon is NOT selling the Nexus 7 itself, but merely providing 3rd Party sellers a place to sell it. Occasionally Amazon takes care of the shipping, but this is not an Amazon company product. It will be cheaper elsewhere.The 32 GB version was released on October 29th, 2012. The 8 GB version was discontinued and the 16 GB version dropped $50 in price. The 3G cellular version went on sale on November 13, 2012 only on T-Mobile and AT&T; networks for $300 big ones.A few things key to know about the 32 GB version:Flash memory works faster the more there is up to a plateau of around 480 GBs. Benchmarks on the 32 GB Nexus 7 show a slight improvement in speed in most activities. Meaning, despite having the same parts of its smaller sized brethren, the 32 GB will see a few seconds shaved off in terms of performance. The Nexus 7 8/16 versions were plenty fast already.Asus should have fixed many of the defects that plagued the early releases from screen separation, light bleed, bad audio plugs, etc. Sometimes it pays to wait for technology.Not all 32 GB are free for the user. Based on the previous models, you should have around 28 to 29 GB of empty space available.Let's address some of the perceived flaws and some of the real flaws of the Nexus 7.1) Storage. 8/16/32gb (the three flavors the Nexus 7 comes in) can go real fast real quick in today's age of HD movies. I took my 16gb iPad on a trip and I maxed out with movies incredibly fast, even after I shrunk them down to least tolerable quality. The Nexus 7 does deserve some criticism for no Micro-SD slot and I was not going to buy it for that sole reason. However, like all good Android Tablets, there's a solution.It's called USB On The Go. You take a USB OTG cable (like $1 here or on eBay), plug it into your Nexus 7, download the Nexus Media Importer app (Currently $3 on Google Play) and then connect whatever side hard drive or flash drive you want. The largest size external media I could connect to (and have access too) is a 3TB Western Digital. So much for 8/16/32 gig limits! The only problem I encountered with large drives is that the Media Importer app (which streams media as well as allowing one way coping to the Nexus 7) is that it crashes when you try to stream media out of folders that contain huge amounts of files, like 3,000 mp3s. Oh yeah. And this requires absolutely ZERO rooting. Take your Nexus out of the box. Download the Nexus Media Importer App. Buy the cable. Plug in your thumb drive. You're good to go.Kickstarter recently funded a MicroUSB MicroSD reader which will allow owners of certain devices (including the Nexus 7) to access MicroSD Cards. Google ""Meenova.com"" for more information about when they are going to be released for the general public. This will function the same as an OTG Cable, but instead let you access MicroSD rather than USB Flash drives.If you're cheap, you can do much of the same via Stickmount and a file manager (Stickmount requires rooting). But the Nexus Media Importer just makes it ridiculously easy. Also be aware that apps that move other apps to SD cards in other tablets will not work with this. Apps such as App 2 SD don't do anything. I tried.As of today (11/19/12), I was able to connect a canon point and shoot, iPad 3, iPod Touch, 4 small flash drives (less than 2 GB), a 32 gb flash drive, a 1 TB and 3 TB external hard drives (Western Digital), a SD card reader (with regular and microSD via adapter) and was able to pull/stream files off all of them (FAT and NFTS formatting, no EXFAT at the moment sorry!). For some reason my old Motorola ZN5 (ancient eh?) no longer registers anymore, but as long as you plug in relatively new devices you'll be okay. An exception is I plugged in my 9 year old iRiver player and it streamed music perfectly.Don't forget that OTG also lets you plug in and use keyboards (wired and wireless via dongle) and mice without rooting. Mice generate a cursor when plugged in. Also be aware that OTG may charge devices from your Nexus 7. For you true gamers, PS/3 controllers work as well. Not on all games, but games like Dead Trigger they'll work just like they do on a PS/3. Like to see that on a Kindle Fire or an iPad.Speaking of that issue: Game controllers and utilities such as Sixaxis and Stickmount (among other apps) require rooting. To those who are unsure of what rooting is, rooting grants the user access to the most bottom command line access of a device. Be aware this voids your warranty, risks turning your device into a very expensive paperweight and prevents auto updating of updates over the air. I learned this the hard way. Search on the XDA developer's website how to root, but research how to do it before attempting. There are benefits and disadvantages of rooting. Make sure that you know exactly why you are rooting.One CAVEAT to this, you have to use digital rights management free media. Mp3s are generally fine as iTunes is now selling DRM free as is Amazon. Direct downloaded movies are another story. You can also rip legitimately owned DVDs and downsize them for the Nexus. Those will play fine. Also, using other media players like DICE or BSPlayer will let you play formats that the Google Video Player doesn't like, like MKV or MTS.2) Display. Yes, it's not an iPad 3 or 4 or a Nook HD (which by the way is gloriously beautiful). It's also less than half the price of the new iPad. Text is still crisp and clean and colors are largely well done. Not take that-iPad well done, but save yourself lots of cash well done. It's fairly responsive, not quite iPad responsive, but better than many other tablets out there. I have no complaints about it. I honestly don't think people will notice the difference between the two in sharpness and text, but it is not as good in showing colors. That said, the Nexus 7 has a better screen then the iPad Mini. Go to your local Apple store, look at the iPad 4s and then the Mini. Prepare to be shocked. It's that noticeable.3) Camera is pretty terrible. The front facing 1.2 megapixels is nothing to get excited about. And there is no back camera. I honestly don't get why that's just a big deal. You look like a tool using the back camera. Anyone does. Even Olivia Wilde (13 on a total possible score of 10 house fans!) would look like a douche using a tablet's back camera to take video/pictures. Odds are you have your smartphone with a decent camera. Use that. There oddly though, is no app for the camera that ships with the Nexus 7. But there is a free Nexus 7 camera launcher app. One cool thing about the camera is that it does allow Face Unlock which takes a picture of your face and uses it as the unlocking mechanism for your tablet.4) Apps. The Apple ecosystem has far more apps designed for tablets than Android does. But most of your apps, like Skype, Facebook, office utilities are all there. Furthermore, rather than being stuck on iTunes you can install Amazon's app store in addition to the preloaded Google Play store via going to the Amazon App Store, registering your email and then opening the email they send you on your tablet. It's annoying but it works. One word of caution on the Apple selling point: according to a few studies, something like 60% of all apps on iTunes (roughly 400,000) have never been downloaded which gels with the economic data showing only a relatively few app developers actually make any money.5) No cellular connection. Fair enough, but it does have the capacity to get on to a hotspot. Meaning, just tether your smart phone. Granted, that costs money, but the fact that something like 80% of all tablets sold, Android and Apple are wi-fi only suggests that cellular connections on tablets is highly overrated. If you're one of those 8 out of 10 people who don't care about cell connections on your tablet, this shouldn't obviously matter.The 3G cellular model available now on Google Play sells for $300. Also, does not support CDMA networks so no Verizon or Sprint. Ships with an AT&T; sim card.6) No Flash - This is technically half wrong. While Jelly Bean does not support Flash off the bat, there are FREE fixes to get flash on to your Nexus.Google ""Install Flash On Nexus 7""The downside is you need a browser that is flash coded which includes Firefox Beta (free on Google play). It's a bit convoluted but follow the instructions and you'll have your flash games. I've posted pictures on the Nexus 7 8GB image gallery of both flash games AND streaming flash video off my Nexus 7. Flash is being phased out entirely by Adobe. It's not pretty on the nexus 7 but you can get it to work, especially if you need to stream Amazon movies.7) No home screen rotating - Not true! Update 4.1.1 fixed this. Home screen rotates now!Now on to other things:Performance:Little black rectangle is lightning fast. The five core processor (yes, there are five I'll get to that later) loads things speedy without crashes and without bugs. My iPad crashes apps pretty regularly. Only once has my settings crashed but that was largely due to me screwing up my setup of my Wi-Fi extender. I can't fault the Nexus 7 for that. Speaking of which, the Nexus was super useful walking all over my house and yard to diagnosis network dead zones and other problems. 3/4 of a pound and strong Wi-Fi pick up made that job real easy, especially with free Wi-Fi apps. I could have done that with my iPad, but that would have been far less fun. Also, the Nexus 7 picks up Wi-Fi networks my iPad doesn'tOh yes, five cores. The process actually has a fifth core that keeps basic services running when the device is in sleep mode. That saves massive amounts of energy. The battery life on the Nexus is better than my iPad without comparison even when doing the same things. The fifth core doesn't operate during normal operations. Battery life on this device is phenomenal.On light usage, I am able to get ~195 hours before hitting 5% battery. On medium, movie watching no heavy gaming, I can regularly do ~110 hours before hitting 5%. GPS however, will eat power like nobody's business.Speaker is pretty terrible compared to iPad. But the audio on headphones is on par. I don't expect anyone to really use the speaker so I'm not counting that as a real disadvantage.Operating System:Jelly Bean on the Nexus 7 isn't as smooth as iOS 5/6 but it is better than every other Android device that my friends and family have used (and I played around with). Jelly Bean is more smooth than iOS 5/6 on my Nexus 4 though. Hardware seems to be the difference.The most recent update 4.2 allows multiple users accounts on the tablet (same as Nook HD) and 4.3 has added types of accounts, both full and limited. Limited allows a limited account to share the apps of a full user, thus eliminating the problem of having to buy apps multiple times. A limited account can also be limited in what apps are shared thus giving users some form of parental controls.Because this is a Nexus device, Google is pushing out updates regularly and you don't have the problem that many Android phones have in their carrier refuses to release updates. You'll have the most recent update of Google for the foreseeable future.What I like about the Nexus 7 is that I can largely customize anything I want. The Nexus ships with a format that is more phone than tablet, but with a Root and a few apps, I was able to switch it to the Tablet UI that you see in 10"" Android tablets. I personally prefer that format but it makes icons smaller to fit it all in. Not the best for older people. But that's the great thing about Android in general. Whatever you want to change, you probably can. And the Nexus 7 is no different.Google Voice Search is pretty awesome. It's not as good as Siri in actually reading back answers to you, most of my searches lead to a web search with links. Weather does get repeated in a Siri like female voice. Speak slowly and clearly. Or you'll get weird results. Also, phrase questions more as searches than something you'd ask a real human. Google Voice does not do well with questions like ""do I need an umbrella today?"" Ask ""Weather forecast (your location).""Also Google Voice does not have the witty banter of Siri. For instance, asking Siri ""what are you wearing"" gets her to say ""Why do people keep asking me that?"" Google Voice doesn't do that kind of funny stuff.GPS & Directions:Now, in my opinion, one of the coolest things about the Nexus 7 is in the built in GPS coupled with the free cached maps. Say you're going to visit your friend who's getting married in small town in Iowa. You can either buy a GPS or bring your Nexus 7 with the map of the small town saved to memory. Turn on the GPS and it will track where you on in the town on the map real time no wifi/cell connection required. I downloaded a map of my town and tracked myself going to work. Planning your route out can easily turn the Nexus 7 into a GPS system without any additional costs.Note, this doesn't give you turn by turn directions by itself. To get turn by turn directions you need the ""NAvFree USA"" (there is a Navfree for other countries) app off the Google Play store. It's free. Download your state and set your destination. It gives out voice commands on when to turn similar to a dedicated GPS device. It doesn't name street names which is expected considering it's free, but it is largely accurate saying ""in 100 meters, turn right."" My recent test of the app did ask me to drive over a divided highway though. As long as you pay attention though, this app coupled with the Nexus 7 will function as decent GPS offline, no wifi, no cell connection. And it even recalculates the route if you miss a turn.Other:Widgets are small applications that sit on your home screens showing whatever you want. Right now I have weather, Settings controls, Youtube, Facebook and Salon online magazine. It's real nice to be able to look at your screen and get all the info you need rather than having to crack open an app or a browser. This is partially why Android web usages is much lower because there's no need to go to the Web to get information when it's right on your home screen.I previously argued that this device was awful for note taking. I take part of that back. While the screen is tiny, using a real keyboard either via OTG or Bluetooth isn't that bad after I spent a month doing it. I still suggest getting a real laptop, iPad or Galaxy Note 10.1, but this will do in a bind. There's no latency in typing like other Android products have seen. The Asus Transformer with keyboard has a real noticeable latency issue when typing so much so it's unpleasant to type. The Nexus 7 with keyboard can write as fast as you can.A couple things I noticed:1) Some apps will cause a restart after updating. Turning off auto-update in Google Play will speed up your device as programs are no longer sucking resources to update on their own.2) Android itself doesn't do a very good job of reallocating resources over time. I need to restart my Nexus 7 about every two to three weeks where I can let my iPad 3 go for two to three months without restarting. It's a minor irritant.If you're looking to jump into Android, this is the tablet to do so.Especially if you're an Ender's Game fan.",How mano hours do you think is the battery life?,[],[],[],[],[]

There are several fixes, but the most common and reliable way is to go to your Computer Management (Windows) and click the unrecognized drive ""online"". You can then assign it a different Drive Letter which will then allow you to see it every time you plug it in. Without going into too much details, basically WD assigned the same signature to the drives that is why it is showing up as one drive at a time. As a result, I moved the rating up to 5 stars. Enjoy!///Original: 12Oct2012///I love how small it still is (compared to a regular 1TB). When I travel I try to maximize my contents without compromising the weight and space taken. I often have to travel in just a backpack for several days so having the drive is perfect for having my digital movies and tv because it does not require an adapter for power (just USB) and it does not take up so much room. Because of the amount of files I own, I ended up buying 3 of these (only needed 2, but didn't realize I previously bought one already).I do however have some issues with it. Unfortunately, laptops cannot recognize two of the same type of drive. So if you were to transfer files from one drive to the next, you much use a median to temporarily store your data first (ie. laptop itself or a non-WD 2TB Passport Drive).Other than that, I am quite satisfied. Data transfer with USB 3.0 is noticeably superior to USB 2.0. In comparison to cheaper drives with USB 3.0 (not to cause blame on other drives), this performed data transfer faster and more consistently. I have used mine for some time now and through my travels overseas and it is still going strong even with the climate changes (extreme hot in the desert and snowing winter).Bottom line, a must have item for large media files during any time of travels due to its capacity, portability, and size.

Read the original review, it is still true.I bought this particular product because I need high capacity ""live"" and fast storage while I consolidate and re-organize the video materials that underlie the almost 900 YouTube videos I have created.I bought a USB 3 adapter (Winstars WS-UH302P USB 3.0 PCI-Express Card, 2 external port) from a local computer vendor: the data transfer rate difference between USB3 and USB2 is well worth the cost of the adapter ... and the price on this HDD device is excellent! The transfer rate of the drive itself is excellent.Discovered one of the ""smart"" aspects of this Seagate drive: when you power the computer down, this expansion drive also powers down.  At first I was irritated that it didn't have a power switch, but now understand why a switch isn't needed  :^)When running, the case is barely warm to the touch ... the design and placement of the passive venting holes appears to have been done right.Under Windows 7, you just plug it in and the needed driver is automatically taken care of.  (Under Win2000Pro, the anti-virus tried to block the automatic driver set up ... easily remedied.)Unlike some USB3-based stand alone products, the USB3 cable in the box is long enough to reach!  They did not skimp on that.The upshot is this: I liked the first one so much, I shortly bought another of the same (and same USB3 adapter) for my other Win7 machine.If this drive crashes (somehow) prematurely, I'll let you know.

Color and picture were fabulous right out of the box.. I didn't even make any adjustments.It  does have a Toslink digital sound output connection if you have a newer receiver which accepts that output.  It is likely super cheap because it doesn't have a headphone jack, which would provide the dual benefit of analog outs and automatically cut off the tv speakers.  You can do all that with the menu and the digital output... Toslink... if you have a newer AV receiver.  It accepts an SD card for pictures, but haven't used that, nor the ipod dock.

I suspect you could pair that $118 blu ray/dvd upscaler to this tv... plug in usb pictures that way, but this is only a supposition.My one small beef was installing the base... not enough to drop a star.  Get yourself a pair of needle nose pliers and #2 medium sized phillips head screw driver if you do not have them,  before attempting the assembly.  You must lay the TV face down on a table (use a towel to protect it), then slide the base's steel attaching plate into the center of the bottom of the TV, and align the plate's 4 screw holes, slide each of the screws carefully down a 2 inch deep, 1/2 inch by 1/2 inch ""tunnel"" (using needle nose pliers) and then ""drop"" them into the holes, hoping they stand up.... stick the phillips head screwdriver down... catch the screw and screw it in.

Basically, you plug it in and then register it on your computer. Depending on which programs you will use with it, you just go onto your computer and enter a code and everything is set up.That being said, while I still truly love this player, I have a couple of issues with it.1) I am always afraid that I will lose the remote. It is so small.2) The remote is erratically responsive or unresponsive. It seems like you have to get it at the exact angle for it to work correctly. This can be annoying.3) It got unplugged one day, and my amazon.com video library did not show up anymore. I'm not sure if this was an amazon.com issue or a roku issue, but I had to uninstall the amazon on demand program and then re-set it up.4) The quality is not always what I would expect HD to be even though I have it plugged in with a gold HDMI cable.

We enjoy all it has to offer so much that we plan to cut our cable TV provider out of the loop at the end of the month. With Roku's ability to stream from sources like Netflix and Hulu Plus, we have our fill of TV episodes, and there are plenty of movie sources too.In this market, none of the selections are perfect at this point. Some competitors don't offer Hulu Plus, some are difficult to use and setup, some come and go within a few weeks. And the Roku is no exception. It has a few issues too.We run into a few stutters and freezes every once in a while - including the Roku box crashing and resetting. This is probably the channels themselves, but it is still a pain.While the interface is clean and user friendly, it could probably use a facelift to speed it up. Instead of apps all being on one line, it would be nice if they were placed on rows. My channel list is growing. In addition, many apps would benefit from a keyboard capability on the remote. Fortunately, the iPhone apps can provide this capability in some cases. But having it built into the Roku and remote would be nice.The only major disappointing issue is the lack of streaming from DLNA or network shares. You can plug a USB drive in, but you can't just stream from a share on the same network. Why not? Seems that Roku would have taken all the begging from customers into consideration and added such a feature. Many of their competitors offer the feature. There are a few workarounds, but they are a pain in the rear to setup and don't work as well as they could.Hopefully the Roku firmware can and will be updated to accept more filetypes and to support the network drives. But there is no telling at this point.But with those issues noted, the Roku was still the best bet compared to the competitors. At least for us. Hulu Plus is a big draw since many of the shows we like are on it (and many of the competing products that have the ""extras""we want, don't offer Hulu PLus). The simplicity is a necessity. It's nice that the Roku uses very little power consumption. And the abundance of channels is great.In addition, the kids enjoy the game capabilities, but I don't think it will be replacing our game consoles any time soon.Overall, we are very pleased with the Roku and will be getting rid of our cable TV provider in favor of the streaming apps in the Roku device.

Read ""Update"" at the bottom of this article.Fit and finish is great.  Fits on my D700 without issue and looks like it was made for it.  Controls work fine.  The Zeikos has a rubberized finish where you would grip it for portrait shots, which looks and feels just like the rubber on the D700.  Ergonomically it's very nice.  My only ergonomic issue is not with the grip, it's with the camera strap which tends to obscure the viewfinder when you turn the camera vertically.  But this would be an issue with the MB-D10 also.The holder for the EN-EL3 is flimsy; be very careful inserting and removing the battery in the plastic holder.  I don't know if it's possible to buy the holder separately if it breaks.  I don't want to find out.When using the AA battery pack, the Nikon D700 will fire at its maximum frame rate, which it won't do with the EN-EL3.  This is why I bought the product as I take a lot of action shots.The problem is, after using the AA battery pack for a few minutes, the D700 will throw an error and refuse to fire.  I get the same results using fresh non-rechargeables and freshly charged rechargeables.  So far I've been able to fix the issue by turning off the camera, removing the battery pack, removing the camera's battery, wait a few seconds, then reinsert the camera battery.  I had read that this product can fry your camera's electronics, which I believe is FUD by those who want to sell you the much more expensive Nikon MB-D10.  But it is disturbing that the camera errors when using the AA adapter.  I have not yet had an error when using the EN-EL3.This feature (using AA batteries and getting the faster cycle time) was highly desired but doesn't appear to be working.  Had this worked, the product would have gotten a higher score.I've heard that this grip will work with the en-el4a, but the cost of the battery (plus cover and battery charger) is so prohibitive that I've declined to do the experiment.Update:I'm changing my rating to 4 stars.  I'd change it to 5 stars if Zeikos releases an en-el4 end cap that exactly fits the grip.  (See below.)As mentioned in a reply to this article, I got it working with the AA battery pack by changing a setting in the camera.  You have to tell the camera what kind of AA batteries are in the grip.  I'm currently using Sony 2500 mAh ""CycleEnergy"" rechargeables, and they work fine, at the full 8 fps of which the D700 is capable.  I take action shots at horse shows, usually 700 -- 800 shots per show, mostly at full continuous speed, and a fully charged set of AAs will lose just one bar off the power meter after a day of shooting.  I've also noticed that the Sonys keep their charge at least as long as the Nikon batteries do.  I always charge up before a pro shoot, but for casual use I don't bother, and the batteries don't appreciably lose charge sitting in the bag.After four months of hard use, I've had absolutely no problems with this grip.  The rubber coating has not peeled off, there are no cracks or other stress signs, and the grip still attaches solidly to the camera.  I've used it handheld and mounted on a tripod with no problems.  It's been so convenient that I leave it on the camera.  (Which tells me I should have gotten a D3s instead of a D700 but that's another story.)I did finally spring for the en-el4 battery pack and the official Nikon endcap.  The battery pack works fine in the grip.  As others have noticed, the official Nikon end cap for the en-el4 does not fit exactly right on the grip.  There's a small gap in one spot.  It doesn't affect operation, and it's nowhere near your hand, but I would be concerned about weather sealing.  I'll use it in dry weather but will probably go back to the Zeikos battery pack when I have to shoot in inclement weather.  It's too bad Zeikos doesn't make an end cap that fits properly on this grip.  I'd buy one.I haven't done a lot of shooting yet with the en-el4, but a few tests show that I still get full continuous speed and the camera works flawlessly.Second update:I've owned this device 18 months now.  I thought I'd be taking it on and off the camera depending on whether I needed the vertical shutter, extra battery capacity or faster frame rate.  In practice, I keep the grip on the camera all the time.  It gives the camera a more solid feel, and I use the vertical controls a lot more than I thought I would.I now have two EN-EL4a batteries, and have had no problems using them in the grip.  I keep the AA adapter in my bag in case of emergency, but haven't needed in a long time.I shoot mostly action in outdoor settings, and my camera tends to see hard use.  The D700 has scars from being dropped, has part of the paint rubbed off from use, and the rubber on the body is starting to peel away in one spot.  You'd think this Chinese made knock-off grip would look even worse, but it is so far showing no significant signs of wear.  The rubber is still firmly attached, nothing has rubbed off with use and all the controls still work.I was a little anxious about buying this because of rumors that it would ""fry your camera"" or wouldn't hold up to field work, but I now have to admit, this is probably the best sixty bucks I have spent in a long time.  Here's hoping Zeikos manages to keep up this level of quality.Third update:I've had this grip for two years now.  It's rarely off the camera, and has seen heavy use with Nikon EN-EL4 battery packs.  (About 20,000 clicks during this time.)  It has taken a lot of abuse, including falling out of the car, and still works fine.  The only oddity I have noticed is that rarely (about five times in six months) the shutter release on the grip will stop working.  I *think* this happens when I swap batteries, but I haven't characterized the problem yet, mostly because it happens so rarely.  Turning the camera off, waiting a few seconds, and turning it back on, solves the problem.  My current theory is that it happens when I forget to turn off the power when swapping batteries, but don't know for sure yet.  Will update again if I find the root cause.I'm still really happy with this product.  I shoot in portrait mode a lot, and the vertical grip is very comfortable.

Prior to this D-Link router, I had a linksys. I mostly gravitate toward linksys and stay away from Belkin. Those are my preferences. I haven't tried a D-Link in a long time and I very satisfied.LOOKS. Let's just say I call it The Pod. It is sleep and nice looking. Still looks like a pod from a Terminator movie.SETUP. Setup was so easy, it can very well be termed plug and play. The simple setup was easy to do with the QRS app. I set up the 5 GHz and 2.4 GHz. Since then, I have used it  few times to change passwords and network names. I also set up a guest network and furthered configured the router at the ip address.RANGE. Wow. The range on this router is amazing. I tested it out to 1/10th of a mile and I still had wifi signal to my router (one which was still able to navigate online). Having a signal 4 houses down my own....that's awesome.INSTRUCTIONS. These sucked. Don't even include the ip address.SETTING UP REMOTE ACCESS. This has taken quite a while and I still have problems with it. I might just stick with the pogo plug. The pogo plug has been more reliable than this difficult to set up process. I was merely trying to connect a hard drive.CONCLUSION. This router has amazing range and it looks great. The initial setup was very easy. Further setup was slightly more complicated, especially since the router included mediocre I instructions. The apps are helpful. But, remote sharing has proven to be a hassle to setup.",What is the highest range?,[],[],[],[],[]

Purchased this keyboard at a major retail store yesterday and immediately returned it.  This is an excellent keyboard, the design is elegant, the keys feel very nice,the backlighting is nice and its truly whisper-quiet.  However, this keyboard has one MAJOR flaw that makes it not usable for gaming.  The keyboard has a feature that is supposed to help with typing mistakes, and it basically only allows for 2 simultaneous key presses at once for most keys...if there is a 3rd key pressed it does not take that input.This is a show stopper for gaming because one critical combination does not work: you can't press the Spacebar key while pressing a letter key and shift.  So basically in FPS games, you cannot jump while sprinting.  In practice this feels completely debilitating.  I immediately noticed the flaw in BF3, and tried it with other games (including Skryim) and can confirm that its an issue.  I checked reviews on Newegg and many reviewers mentioned the same flaw.So if you're looking to use this keyboard for anything other than gaming, I would highly recommend it.  However it just can't be used for gaming as you can't press mutliple keys at once.  Sad considering everything else about this keyboard is fantastic.",How is the design?,['the design is elegant' 'the design is elegant'],[208 208],[1 1],[1. 1.],[ True  True]

This is my first tablet, although I have friends with iPads, iPad minis and the original Nexus 7, all of which I've used before.  To me, this device blows them all away and for the price you can't go wrong.I got the 16GB model because I'm not one of those people who stores a lot of content locally on the device.  I usually keep about 50 apps installed, some of them games, and there's plenty of storage for all of that.  The rest of my media is either streaming or stored in the cloud.  There's no microSD expansion, but honestly, I don't really miss it so far.  Cloud storage shared between your various devices is the future, and so far it's working well on this tablet as well as on my phone.The screen is straight up gorgeous, and content looks clean and crisp.  I'm running mine with auto-brightness and it seems to always pick a good happy medium between visibility and battery savings, so no complaints there.  Small text is easy to read and Netflix videos look great.  The dual speakers are loud enough, but they don't personally blow me away.  They do go to full volume without any noticeable distortion, however, so that's good.  If you're using this tablet for playing music you may be slightly disappointed, but for watching YouTube videos and movies they're perfectly acceptable.The battery life so far has been stellar.  Mine came out of the box yesterday with a 59% charge, and by the end of the night (about 7 hours later) with HEAVY use I was down to 19%.  The battery is technically smaller than the previous generation's battery, but this new chipset uses that power more efficiently and the device sips power in standby mode so this should last you 2 days on a charge unless you're constantly streaming full HD movies to it.  It does support wireless charging using the Qi standard, but I haven't tested that out yet although I fully plan on getting a wireless charging pad soon.Overall system performance has been nice and snappy.  It's my understanding they're using OpenGL for the system UI now, and all the animations and transitions feel much smoother than they ever have before.  Just swiping through and navigating around Android 4.3 feels great.  iOS may still be a bit smoother, but the difference to me is negligible after this most recent update to the Android OS.And my personal favorite feature is the name itself; This is a Nexus device and will come with all the developer goodies that I've come to love.  This is my 3rd Nexus device and I love how easy it is to flash custom software to it.  Within 20 minutes of getting this thing home yesterday I had unlocked the bootloader, flashed a custom recovery and backed up my current ROM before rooting it.  It's only a matter of days until we get custom ROMs coming out for it with cool features added in.  I'm personally looking forward to using the PIE controls and getting HALO running on it.If you're in the market for a tablet that's not too big to be portable, and that sits at a killer price point for the screen/performance that you get, the new Nexus 7 is a no-brainer.",How do I send a text message?,['Small text is easy to read'],[1047],[1],[0.6166667],[ True]

Needless to say last night I learned that porn is stronger than the Nighthawk.Parental Control Problems:1. If you set the router on the highest setting for network protection it filters porn, however it also filters out pretty much anything but first grade friendly material. A no-go for a house with a teenager who has reports to do for school and needs internet access.2. In the Parental Control interface you can setup strict browsing for the family and an override account for those who don't need or want it, but using 'custom' settings is frustrating and seems to be hit and miss for porn specifically.3. In the Parental Control settings you can add up to 25 sites you want blocked. That's it - and it's not enough for all trash on the internet!4. In the Genie dashboard under Advanced - Security you can add keywords and domains (yuck dot com, dot net...) to block. When those are set, if a user attempts to go there they get a black screen with red stripes that says 'Firewall Blocked' user.5. Removing a 'keyword' is a joke too! You have to clear the list and start over, as it won't let you delete just one word like 'porn' to eliminate all sites with that keyword in the title from opening.You can set things up so that the administrator gets emailed every time one of the blocked sites gets a 'knock, knock' by a user on your network. Unfortunately, this too has a limited number of sites and/or keywords that can be added, and it's just not enough for the price you pay for this router!The speed and stability is great, but I hate that with this expensive piece of equipment and user-interface that seems to be so helpful - these limitations are put on the device.I didn't buy this router to limit porn, but it is one of the things I like to do on my home network. I'm not a prude, but I should be able to surf securely if that's part of what's promised at a premium price.Oh, and the way I found this out was that I periodically go onto a browser like Bing or Google and type in random words and phrases to see what shows up. When it's something related to porn and I know I have the filter set, I click to make sure they are blocked. Last night, it wasn't and I spent nearly 3 hours learning the limitations of the NETGEAR Genie software.Maybe this is something that can be addressed by the NETGEAR Team in an update? It will definitely have to be improved upon to be considered a safe router for households who are concerned with Parental Controls,  and I would not recommend this router for this reason.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This is a huge, pricey wireless router which is worth every penny if you're living in a big home, have multiple devices all wanting WiFi, want to be able to take command of your network in darn near every way possible or 'all of the above'.WHY I CHOSE THIS WIRELESS ROUTER...I purchased this router with some trepidation due to the high sticker price. It's twice as expensive as the most expensive one I've previously purchased and also twice as big.  Despite these things, I was looking for a router to replace myBelkin N750 Wireless DB Dual-Band Gigabit N+ Router With High Speed HD Streaming & USB (F9K1103), which while OK, was struggling to keep up with the growing WiFi demands of my family.With 15 wireless devices used on the network (laptops, desktops, streaming devices, smartphones, gaming systems, etc...), if everyone was connected, we all experienced signal drop offs. When streaming video it was not uncommon to get lagging connections and/or encounter buffering issues.After reading a bit about higher end routers, I decided to get a simultaneous dual band router. This one works well as you can set the (QoS - Quality of Service) to uploads (for gaming) or to downloads (for streaming). These two things opened up a whole new level of enjoyment in this cord cutter household!Having written a book on cord cutting:Simple Guide to Over-the-Air Free TV, and using myRoku 3 Streaming Media Player,Google Chromecast HDMI Streaming Media PlayerandApple TV MD199LL/Ato supplement my over air HD TV network programming, I know the importance of a solid WiFi network and this NETGEAR Nighthawk beautifully gets the job done. Netflix, Amazon Prime Instant Video and Hulu Plus all load more quickly and offer great picture quality and stability.In addition to this router's awesome performance and range, this NETGEAR product has a fantastic software utility suite (for both PC and MAC) with free iOS and Android apps. The software is easy to use and highly customizable.  I love the Parental Controls, which can be set for the whole network, or just for specific devices.THE PROS:+ Exceptional range.+ Outstanding speed (*more than doubled my download speed from 33Mbps to 68Mbps) with simultaneous dual band (2.5Ghz and 5Ghz).+ Excellent security settings, which are setup for you at installation. **NOT true - see update!***+ Whisper quiet.+ Lights can be turned OFF in NETGEAR Genie (Settings - Advanced - LED Control Settings) or have them blink, or remain solid - your choice!+ QoS settings make customizing your network a breeze for the things you do most whether they are gaming or streaming; by group or per device.+ Can set up a VPN (Virtual Private Network) to access your network from anywhere.+ Lots of options for tweaking the setup, if you desire it.+ READYSHARE for printers or for network storage and back-up is a great feature.+ Guest network setup is optional.+ At a glance access to all the devices on your network by app or PC with NETGEAR Genie software.+Setup Wizard in 'Advanced' area of NETGEAR Genie works to effortlessly get you online.+ You can set up FTP storage.+ DLNA enabled for media server functionality; including iTunes library.+ USB 3.0 port for connecting external storage or media server.+ Ability to block specific sites or sites by keyword, in addition to Parental Control settings which are highly customizable.+ Ability to block services on a schedule.+ Ability to have WiFi turn off during scheduled times during the day or by entire days of the week.+ Ability to set up email alerts when devices on the network attempt to connect to specific sites.+ Ability to enable wireless repeater function.+ Ability to see traffic loads (upload/download) on your network.+ The router can be hung on a wall or sit on a desktop.+ Very cool to the touch, with excellent ventilation on the sides of the device.+ You can set password recovery questions when you reset your password from the default 'password' at start up.THE CONS:- It's HUGE, and the 'wingspan' with the three antennas attached makes it about the same footprint as a 15"" laptop. (I have mine hanging on the wall with the cables coming out the top for easy access.)- Initial setup even with NETGEAR Genie did not go smoothly for me, and I'm an intermediate to advanced user. Small tweaks here and there in the NETGEAR Genie got all of my devices to play well together eventually though.- The price is hefty compared to other wireless routers for home use, but its features and speed are impressive.THINGS TO NOTE...Firmware updates must be made out of the box; Advanced - Administration - Router Updates and then 'Apply'. (You can get the latest prior to setting up your router and install it by finding the file on your computer, or let the router connect and obtain it.)There's an iOS app called 'Net Analyzer Lite' that I found to be very useful in identifying some of my devices by MAC address. This in addition to the NETGEAR Genie app are both free, and well worth the downloads.This is an impressive package both in terms of hardware and software. I'm very pleased with this purchase and I highly recommend it to those who want a feature-packed router with top notch speed and security settings. I think it would be ideal for a small business, multi-level or large home, or any sized home with lots of devices (10+) who are all competing for bandwidth.Highly recommend this one if you can afford it!UPDATE: 5/11/14 - I'm loving this router! Netflix flies through shows using 5Ghz and no buffering with a Roku 3. I can download an album to the Amazon Cloud in about 15 seconds and every web browser: Chrome, IE, Opera, Safari... loads pages faster. I'll be hooking up a Seagate USB 3.0 external drive with movies to use the DLNA feature and will update this review after that use.Overall, I can't say enough good things about this purchase.UPDATE: 5/17/14 - That 'love' was short lived and the 5 star rating was dropped to a '2' star based upon porn getting through and the limited ability to add blocked sites or keywords for added security. Paying this much for a router - it should have solid security as well as speed.",Why do I have a large footprint?,"['and the \'wingspan\' with the three antennas attached makes it about the same footprint as a 15"" laptop']",[7178],[2],[0.125],[False]

I am astounded by the poor durability of this unit and am glad I brought my Canon camera w/ UW case as a backup and standby. The Playsport doesn't seem to handle humid conditions well. After getting in the water (no more than 4-5 feet of water in 80-85 degree water temp, 90 degree air temp and 70%~ humidity), I noticed the Playsport was having issues turning on underwater. I immediately got out and started noticing condensation build up on the inside of the screen.  After turning it on again, I started getting a blank white screen and the unit would shut off afterwards. I tried letting it dry out but the unit was just dead. After several days of the malfunction, while on the trip, I noticed some corrosion around the power plug port area and hinges. The seals seem a bit flaky in this respect. I made sure to rinse the unit off with freshwater after every outing.The kicker is that I had used this probably a dozen times in the saltwater without any problems. I'm thinking it's not as rugged as it's cut out to be. After considering how much I used it, I put it through a pretty good stress test overall. Unfortunately, it failed. Kodak support didn't seem very supportive of the issue - they wanted me to return the camera, at my expense, with a 7-10 business day turn around. I didn't really want to deal with the back and forth and an experience like that left a bad taste in my mouth anyway. I'd prefer not to be Kodak's QA dept.That said, the video quality is awesome with what I did capture, but I cannot recommend it to anybody with the problems I've experienced. Maybe it was just my unit, but with this experience I will generally be avoiding Kodak products in the future. This, along with so many other reviews of batteries not working and units not charging, is only proving that Kodak's QA process is shoddy at best.I would avoid this unit until Kodak makes major improvements to the ""waterproofing"" aspect as well as all other issues people have been reporting. Personally, I'm going to wait until more companies release comparable waterproof cams (and better reviews) before making such a purchase. My recommendation is this: be very careful with this unit if you plan on using it for a lot of swimming/snorkeling/underwater stuff - it only takes one time underwater for your camera to be destroyed. And also, be wary of the unit's ability (or lack thereof) in places of high humidity. Otherwise, I'd say it's a bargain camera for anything else. It just doesn't seem as ""rugged"" as it's cut out to be.An additional tidbit or caution to note while handling this underwater. Make *sure* you have a secure hold/grip on this unit or that you secure it well using the wrist strap or whatever you come up with. This thing will sink like a brick if you let go of it in the water! If I had brought it to the place we snorkeled where I brought my Canon (and let go of that...fortunately it floated), I almost surely would have dropped it to the bottom 30ft down. And I would have had a fun little diving excursion in that case. Not to mention, likely a dead camera as the rated depth UW is 10ft :T",How is the image of the company?,[],[],[],[],[]

Having said that, my initial impressions are very positive and are as follows:Pros1. The case is very beautiful, stylish, rugged and well designed. It is lightweight and adds little bulk to the device. It fits my iPad Air like a glove and all ports are accessible. In addition, all ports have covers which helps protect them from damage, dust, etc.2. The specs say that the case is shock proof and water resistant. Although I had no chance to verify this personally,  the fit seems tight and it would be difficult for water or dust to penetrate the case.3. The built in screen protector works very well. I removed the original screen protector from the iPad and then applied the built in screen protector. This did make it easier to install the iPad Air in the case and there were no bubbles or grids, as some people experienced,  on the screen. In addition, the touch screen feature of the iPad was very responsive and performed as if the screen protector were not there.4. With the case on, I found that the power, the home and the volume buttons were very responsive to light touch. There was no need to exert substantial pressure to get them to function properly.5. In my opinion, the star of the show is the leather hand strap on this case. It is very stylish, elegant, gives added protection from accidental drops of the device, and makes holding the device very comfortable.  It is adjustable to fit most hand sizes and rotatable to various angles for easy and comfortable viewing of the device. This feature reduces the fatigue of holding the device for long periods. Makes me wonder how did I live without this feature before.6.  The kickstand is made of metal and is very sturdy. It has a bottle opener on it.  It is a good feature to have, but not necessary for my purposes.Cons:None that I would consider a deal breaker.Conclusion:All in all, this is an excellent case for the iPad Air.

Amazon designed this case to be the thinnest, and Amazon may very well have achieved that.  I think this is a good thing. So good, that I have given this case 5 stars.  Just know, you are buying thin.5 stars for thin and protective case... about half an inch with the FireHD 8.9.  (hard to measure, I need calipers!). I will tell you why I think some of the one star ratings are given...and they fall in two areas: One, the case looks cheap when you see the lower half inside. Two, the case can not be propped at a low angle to one's desk and still type well on it. We will look at both of these items... there are, I am sure, other reasons for low rankings, some due to perceptions of ""a good case.""First, everyone has (perhaps) their own perceptions of what a good case is:  My brother has a big Otterbox case (sturdy, shock resistant case) on his thin cell phone. I do not... I have a thin, easy to grip case. Why? Is it because I don't want my phone (and tablet) protected?  Sure I do.  But I am an adult, and I know how to take care of things. The case is there, just in case. :) But, I don't need to protect it to the level of an OtterBox case, in my view.  So that is my preference. If this is not your preference, you are going to hate this thin, beautiful case.Amazon advertises thin, and they deliver thin. And I agree with those who think if they wanted a one inch thick case around their tablet, they would have a netbook or similar, not a tablet (since tablets should be thin and light).  But... but... but... (you may object)...Yes, I know. This case doesn't look like a 50 bucks+ case.  In fact, many have said it is not even leather. I don't know for certainty, but I don't doubt that it is leather. But let me describe the construction and you will see. And why does the bottom half look like it is just plastic!? Read on.The case is a very light plastic shell... and this very thin shell can be seen on the inside of the lower half, so the perception is cheapness. But, the question should be, what is the purpose of this case and what is being accomplished by this plastic? In short, it is providing needed protection and absorbtion for drops around every square inch of the tablet... notice the complete wrap around, form-fitting shape on the bottom half.  Look closely at the bottom half, which has been structured to fit the Fire HD 8.9 like a glove, with perfectly cut openings and stylish design), on the outside of this casing is a wrap around leather covering. Once your tablet is in this case, you never see the plastic, as it is holding your Fire HD 8.9. Then, on top of the shell is a thin, very thin, leather covering that looks like it has been steam fit and glued on top of the plastic. Then a black thread has sewn the edges down so I doubt it would ever come loose.  By necessity then, the leather is not soft to the touch, since it is attached to a plastic shell.  But, it is very likely leather and the reason some think it is all plastic is because of the shell material.The sizing to the actual Kindle Fire HD is what is so amazing.  The bottom of the plastic case just snaps over the bottom of the Fire and then the top lays on the glass of the tablet. Magnets (with Auto Wake and Sleep) keep the case shut (though it might not be good enough to stay shut in a fall).THIN AND LIGHT?Now, I purchased a Moko Case from Amazon too. It was thin, as was my preference.  My Moko Case is about 5/8 of an inch with tablet). This case is 1/2 inch, plus maybe a tad more than half an inch. But, clearly, this case is thinnest of any case that I have seen.Is it lightest?  IT IS NOT. My Moco case is lighter, even though it is tad thicker. Why?  This Amazon case wraps completely around the entire tablet (it doesn't leave any edges exposed. My Moco case does. Still, the slightly thicker padding on the Moco probably provides a bit more protection... but who knows... I am not going to drop test. :) Suffice it to say they are both thin and light weight. One a tad more than the other in each area.THE STAND:The stand on this case has been where many people have commented. Here is my take.First, the stand does work well.  It may not be the best if you like to type on your tablet in a standing mode (as finger pressure would certainly knock the stand over on some surfaces).Remember thin? Well, one thing that makes many cases thicker is the stand mechanism.  Make the stand (or base) too thick and it adds bulk. Make it too thin and it just doesn't stay up.  So, this was the design challenge.  Amazon went with a LACK OF A BASE for their stand.... as well as a lack of a Kick-0ut stand mechanism.  How does it work?  Simple, just fold it over and let the case form a A shape that supports the tablet to stand. Oh, I can hear it now. ""That won't work reliably!""  Well, what they did is make the outer edge side out of a sticky, rubbery material, so that when you prop it opens, it holds quite nicely.  This saves them a lot of weight and thickness. Some don't like it... but I imagine it is people that want to type on the tablet with it propped up in standing position. I think that if the feet are kept fairly clean, they will grab onto any descent surface and hold the tablet upright... and at about any angle that you want.I like this case. I like the design. I like the thinness. The jury still out on the stand (over time) and the magnetic closure (during a potential fall).  I can't do less than five stars, because it does everything it states. Yes, I like my Moco case a bit better, but I bet this case will still be going strong long after my Moco case needs to be replaced.  And now I have a wonderful replacement.JJI will update this review over time.Update: One con is the interior material of the case (the part that hits the screen)...it is not super-soft Micro-fiber cloth, rather a thin cloth that doesn't scratch the screen. A Microfber cloth interior might help keep the screen cleaner, but it would have added thickness. I have seen one reviewer say that cat hairs stick to it. I have not had that problem, and we do have a cat.Update: Price vs. Quality.  Boy, I really wanted to stay out of this discussion. Everyone has their own comfort level with price, so I just try to review the product. But yes, if you are looking at cases in the sub-20 market, this case is pricey in comparison. But, I doubt that anyone who wanted the features of this case, would then think the given price was too much to pay. Key features again?Protective covering that covers the entire tabletConnects to the tablet all the way around, so it isn't going to pop out.Very thin (the thinnest?) and exceedingly lightExtremely easy to open, use, get access to all ports... and even easy to remove, if needed... all while being thin and attractiveLove the wonderful design for the volume rocker and power button. Nice design makes these a breeze to use (unlike my cell phone case).Leather coating (though not soft) seems durable and easy to grip.Speaker vents are perhaps the best I have seen on any case... it doesn't limit sound.Stand is simple and quick to use, because it uses a rubbery material that simply clings to most (but not all) material (I have tried on wood and formica top desks, table cloth, papers on top of a desk (not as good, but works), glass top tables, and wood and ceramic floors). The only time this failed was when I had it on the side of some rubbermaid containers... slipped on that slicker, dustier surface). You can get a nearly straight up position fairly readily, the only real issue is with a low angle such some people like for typing on a tablet. If the surface isn't ideal, the tablet will simply slip down to the table (flat), when you try to type. The benefit is that you have just about every other angle (degree) that you might want to have. That is great if your trying to avoid a glare on the screen, for instance.",What is case?,[],[],[],[],[]

Anyway, Chromecast works basically as promised. It's sort of neat that I can pull up a youtube video on my phone or tablet or computer and get it playing on my big screen.It was apparent right away though that the image was cropped on my screen. I'm running a 1080p stream to a 1080p screen, and don't have this issue with my PS3, Xbox, Blu Ray player, or Boxee or Roku. I streamed my screen as well, and sure enough it wasn't a true representation of my laptop screen. Didn't matter what I streamed from either - I tried doing so from my phone, and the youtube video was cropped on all sides - looked zoomed in. I played around with my tv settings, and it didn't fix the issue. There's no settings to be found for fixing it either.Even zoomed in, it was a nice quick way to send youtube to my tv (even though I have other methods) - it's easily the fastest way considering the time it takes to fire up other devices. Hulu was also zoomed in, and the performance was choppy. I noticed I had to have the video playing in my laptop at the same time and I couldn't close the lid on my laptop. If I went full screen, Hulu would show full screen on my tv, but I couldn't do anything else with my laptop. The video on my laptop was not synced with the video on the screen. So if I want to watch hulu and do other stuff with my laptop, I have to watch it in the browser window which you can see on the tv screen rather than full screen. Full screen crops the video anyway though like I said, so there's really no good way to watch hulu I don't think. Unless I'm missing something.Netflix had the same issue as Hulu with the cropping and full screen. Youtube didn't have the full screen issue where I couldn't do anything else with my laptop... just the cropping.This is a decent little device for the price, but I probably won't use it for much besides youtube streaming. I'd say for what it costs, if you plan to only use it to stream Youtube, it's worth the money. Otherwise, save your hdmi port for something better. If I had a time machine, I would probably not buy it again since I don't really need it. In fact, I may relegate it to the bedroom tv that never really gets used.

I have tried other wireless keyboards, but usually I opt out to scrapping the keyboard and just use the case by itself, but the Airbender Case/keyboard is definitely a keeper.1) It is functional and easy to use as a case and a keyboard.  Functionally from a keyboard perspective I had no issue with sync'ing it up via bluetooth to my Ipad.  Overall the keyboard is responsive, I have not had an issue yet with it either dropping or disconnecting or not recognizing my key strokes.2) Keyboard is nice, keys have a nice heft and snap to it so it feels responsive, almost like a normal keyboard.  Size is nice as well and has the basic keys you would want on a keyboard with other hotkey functions that I like, not having to go through the apple menu options to access (brightness, sound, pictures, internet, etc.)3) Keyboard attached to the Ipad is versatile and works well together, allows for multiple orientations and tilts, one thing it does not do is allow you to extend the ipad away from the keyboard.  Another thing I noticed was If you use the tilt with the whole arm it works fine, but if you try to tilt the screen without moving the arm, it will move back to rest on the arm, not a big deal but an observation I had.  Another thing that I noticed was that sometimes if you had the case open, the weight of the Ipad could tilt the entire case backwards.4) The case itself combined with the keyboard is solid, i have no problem carrying the whole thing around, it does add weight, but what do you expect with an additional keyboard.  I would like to have had the surfaces with more of a rubbery or raised feel so it is easier to grip.  It does allow you to separate the case from the keyboard, but only offers back protection when separate.Overall the case as a whole is great, I do not think I will use just a normal case without the keyboard, this provides so much more function to the overall product.  I no longer an weary of writing long emails on my Ipad now that I have the keyboard to match.  It also provides the needed support and protection to keep your Ipad running for a long, long time!  5***** I would definitely recommend.",Does this have the ability to use batteries?,[],[],[],[],[]

That quit about 5 months ago. I didn't want to pay the $30 or more per month to get the half dozen channels that I actually wanted so I started looking at streaming players. I already used netflix so that was a must have feature and I decided to pick up hulu plus as well. What drove me to the roku though wasn't just the compatibility with the services that I knew I wanted to use, but the breadth of channels and other content that I could access (for free) from the device.Since purchasing the device I've fallen even more in love with it. The channel store is very nice it has all kinds of web based content to fill the void left by leaving cable behind. From free things like TED talks, news channels (ABC, CNN, CBS, BBC, etc), you tube, pandora, and vimeo videos. To pay channels like HBO go (which I'm ""borrowing"" a password for from a friend). I don't tend to play games on the roku, but have tried angry birds and it is entertaining and I could certainly see younger kids enjoying the gaming experience on the roku.I was afraid that I would miss out on picture quality by having to stream from online, but from what I can tell the picture quality is full HD. I even get surround sound on many of the movies and shows that support it. Of course you can turn the quality of the video down and this may become an important feature for some users. I went from using south of 30GB of data per month to closer to 250GB per month when I switched all of my TV service to the roku. As long as you don't have a cap this is fine, but if you do have a low data cap this is something to consider. Most services (Netflix, Hulu, etc) allow you to pick the picture quality from their websites, but there is also a master switch in the roku options menu if you want to turn quality down across the board.The interface of the roku itself is quite simple and intuitive. The channel store could be set up more nicely as it doesn't currently have a search feature, but you can also look at the available channels online and send them to your roku from there. In fact this is the only way to get some of the unlisted channels which carry things like streaming news casts from different parts of the country and other content which isn't provided by any of the media conglomerates.The interface of some of the other apps are better than others. Netflix does come with a nice search feature, but doesn't let you customize the homepage to show the genres that are most important to you. The Hulu Plus homepage will organize episodes or entire series by name or popularity. This can be especially nice when you want to watch recent TV as new episodes are usually the most popular and will drift towards the front of the list. On the other hand the TED talks app has no search feature and only contains about 1/10 the talks that are featured on their website. But I can't fault the device itself for this as these apps are created by third parties.If I did have one complaint for the Roku 2 XS it would be with the remote. And its a very minor complaint. I have a logitech harmony remote which i use to control all of my media components and while it works with most items very well, and does support the roku 2 XS it is not as strong as the regular remote signal. I haven't had any problems with the remote controlling other items so I believe the problem to be with the type of reciever used in the Roku 2 XS. Again the regular remote works fine so this is not a huge deal, but something that might want to be taken into consideration if you want to use a universal remote.TL:DRConclusions:Picture quality: 5 / 5Roku Interface: 4.5 /  5 (lack of a search feature in the channel store)Channel Options: 5 / 5Channel Interfaces: 2-5 / 5 (some are great others are lacking)Things to consider:Do you have a data cap on your internetDo you want to use a universal remote with the Roku(read above if you have fall in these categories)Final Verdict: I would buy it again and lose the cable company in a minute",How is option?,[],[],[],[],[]

I would say it covers 95% of my need, but when I see this nice touch screen universal remote from Logitech that requires internet/software to sync up, I thought maybe I should pay $160 for the touch screen, and given that it would always have the latest update, it must cover all the edge cases and 100% of my need!  Well boy was I wrong--I didn't even get 1% out of this remote!First I am fairly comfortable w/ computer and I have never had issues installing/updating any software, so it's surprising to me that they can screw this up.  But after running into the below issues, I am going to return it (nope, not going to waste time calling their CS)1.  First issue:  It could find my DirecTV DVDR and I need to get the remote to teach it (hey my Sony UR needs to do this too--without any software!  But fine, I did play along)2.  After configuring the software w/ all the  devices, I try to update the H1 remote.  The update got stuck at 3%.3.  It recommended me that I disable my anti-virus and firewall (already off).  So I did and tried again.  Same problem.4.  Googled ""harmony one stuck at 3%"", turns out it's a common issue (so common that when I typed ""Harmony one st"" it autocompletes ""Stuck at 3%"").  There's supposed to be an alternate way to update using a website (If that's the case, why do I need to install the software on my computer!?)5.  Unfortunately, even using the website, the install still stalled at 3%.  I could probably try to reboot my PC and see if that would make a difference, but nope Logitech I am not going to waste more of my time to fix your product.  Path of least resistance to earn your customer, and you have failed my friend.There was another reviewer (who was lucky enough to actually use the remote) who said he could do all the H1 functions w/ his Sony UR without all the fancy software, by pressing 3-digit codes for each device manufacturer.  I couldn't agree more!  Why not just keep it simple?  I have bought many crappy products before, but this is the first time that a product fails to be even set up!!",What is the small problem?,[],[],[],[],[]

If you look in the product photos,you'll see the iPad part connects on a swivel through what is essentially a camera lens cap.  That part is ok and secure,except the camera lens cap part is on a very loose hinge itself.  The main hinge, however, is very stiff.  So, you have to use a fair amount of force to open the case.  Once you get it about 30 degrees or so open, you have to switch your grip.  If you don't, the weak camera lens cap hinge comes into play,and all the force you were putting on the stiff main hinge moves to the no resistance camera lens cap hinge.  More than a few times it would suddenly flip open on me, causing me to nearly drop my iPad.  Not cool.  I also started to experience some other issues, like the keyboard was doubling some letters--like the letter &#34;E&#34;. Talk about the worst letter to double every 4/5 times you type it...Another issue is adjusting the view angle.  The iPad holder part has a ratcheting mechanism that locks the screen at a set distance from the keyboard.  Problem is, it ratchets going out.  Which means any time you what to adjust the angle, the ratchet part offers no resistance and the screen just slides right over the top of the keyboard.  Any adjustments become two handed, one to mess with the stiff hinge and screen angle, the other to make sure the screen stays at the right distance from the keyboard.Finally, the charge light went on and stayed on.  To me, this was indicative of some serious quality issues, and I wasn't going to hang around and see what failed next.",What should be done with the stands?,[],[],[],[],[]

I went to adjust the sound. It wouldn't work. Than I pushed really hard and the sound button imploded. I've had Apple Nano 2nd generation for over 2 years never a problem. I only bought this because I was bored. Price is cheap but if they only last 3 months the value is low.I'll try to warranty it but they'll probably blame on misuse.+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++With a little threatening, they replaced it. So we'll give them credit for standing behind the warranty.  I have it sitting around because I just don't like the short battery life. My 4 year old Nano 2 goes for 12-15 hours compared to the 6-7 hours of this unit and I got tired of it always running out of batteries on me.+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++I'm very satisfied with this unit with one exception. I only get approximately 7 hours of listening time. This is leaving the unit on at a fairly high volume and doing nothing more than listening to books. I subtracted 2 stars because battery life is important to me and I've already run out a few times.I'm using it for Audible exclusively. I had a Ipod Nano 2nd generation and prefer the Sandisk Clip+ unit. This review is for Audible Users, others probably won't be interested in it. I was looking through the reviews and couldn't find a review that would describe the interaction of this unit with Audible Useage.1. Very small and compact- The unit is really tiny. All I want to do is listen to books. The screen is small enough to see easily but doesn't take up space so the buttons are larger.2. Great Sound-This unit sounds as good or better than my Ipod.3. Simple Navigation buttons-Took less than 5 minutes to learn.4. On off button which I use as Pause too. It is well located to the top directly over where the headset plugs in, I can find it by feel and don't need to see it. So it is convenient to find an use. When you turn off the book while running it comes back on at the same point still running. The time to turn on and start playing the book is less than 5 seconds. I've found that this feature is key to my enjoyment of using the unit with Audible. No fumbling through the other buttons to find pause.5. Convenient Lock mechanism, which I never use, just push the home button for 5 seconds. No cumbersome hard to find slide mechanisms. Where this unit blows away the Ipod units is that there is no touch sensitive wheel. Everything is push button. Without that sensitive wheel, I've never had to lock the unit. I had an Ipod which used the wheel which is sensitive so I always had to lock it. Big pain in the neck.7.Sound controls are on the side, again push button and stiff enough not to trigger by accident. I prefer this to the ipod system.8. It organizes each book into it's own separate folder so it's an extra click but your books are organized together9. When part 1 of a book ends it automatically go to the next part.But won't open a new book. This is advantageous because if you fall asleep with Audible running than it runs to the end of the part of the book you are on, than the next part (if you aren't on the last part) and than it goes to sleep. This can reduce battery drain.IE listen before going to bed.10. Uses the standard Mini USB connector (the one that's bigger) so you can charge and Sync with the standard one used on many devices. I just bought 2Technocel MV9MCDUO-SP OEM Sprint Dual USB Port Car Charger - Blackalong with 2Dual Micro USB / Mini USB Splitter Cable - Charge up two Devices (One Micro and One Mini USB) Once From a Single USB Port - Ideal for mp3 players, Digital Cameras, Smartphones (Android, BlackBerry, HTC, Samsung), GPS, and More. This gives me 2 micro USB and 1 Mini USB in my Autos. With 1 of the Micro USB being rapid charge. I love devices with standard Micro USB connection. By the way I have aDMMR: Dual mini USB and Micro USB to USB Sync and Charge Cable (Retractable)at my office and it charged and transferred data flawlessly with this unit.I have a mini usb connection at home that I use for my Card Reader also transferred data and charged it.  Hurray. It's standard Micro USB.12. Fast Forward and Rewind are as good if not better than the Ipod and convenient. Actually the Forward and reverse start slowly, than speed up the more time the button is held. This is advantageous because it allows for both slight f forward/Reverse and extreme f forward/reverse14.Expandable Memory using Micro SDHC. It was just so inexpensive I bought a 8gb MicroSDHC on Amazon for $6.00+ delivered8GB Sandisk MicroSDHC Memory Cardthis one is class 4 don't buy the class 2 might be too slow. With how cheap memory is it's better to buy the 4gb unit and upgrade instead of the 8gb unit. 4 gb does hold alot of books.15. Convenient Eject system from computer- I kept looking for the eject on my Windows Machine to disconnect. Finally I went to the manual. Turns out that as long as you aren't synchronizing you just pull the Unit out with no damage. Very convenient.15. You can listen to it while it's charging.The glitches:1. Battery life. Audible Playback only at fairly high volume using headphones. I only got around 7 hours. my Ipod Nano gets 14 hours. I had to take 2 stars off because that would be a deal breaker for many.2. For Audible can only use the Audible Manager.Remember Audible books are DRM Protected so you need the Audible Manager to decrypt and put on the Clip+3. Their is no way to organize the order of the books. It goes in Alphabetical Order (If I'm wrong please tell me how to do it in comments.4. Itunes tried to take over so I had to remove ITunes but I think that there is a setting or way that I could disableItunes from turning on automatically. Also my original default was through Itunes. Just be aware there may be issues withItunes and Audible Manager on your machine. Probably you can get around it.5. The books are grouped by Books. So if you are in part 1 of a book it'll play part 2 but won't go to the next book.Since it doesnt' go automatically. You have to stop and fiddle with it. This could be inconvenient for example if you are driving. Unfortunately once the book is organized on the machine their is no way to change the order. I have some books where it decided to put the Part 2 at the top and part 1 below. I tried accessing the drive in MTP mode which turns it into a hard drive. In Mtp Mode it showed as in order. So there was no way to fix a problem that doesn't exist when accessing the unit as a hard drive. To find the Mtp and MSC mode it's simple Press the home button&lt;Settings&lt;System Settings&lt;USB Mode&lt; For loading books Audible manager will only recognize in MSC Mode.6. I'd prefer that it used a Micro USB connector which is used on most newer phones.7. Controls are very small. I have to hold it in front of me to use all the buttons except the on off and volume button.8. When Fast rewinding or forward my Ipod used to allow me to hear the words so it was easier to find the spot. This is totally silent.9. If I turn unit off and than back on sometimes it will resume at the beginning of the chapter that I was on. But I had the same problem with my IPOD. So I don't believe it's a Clip+ specific problem.If you like this review please rate it as helpful. When I was deciding whether to purchase this unit, I had trouble finding anything about the compatibility with Audible",How is the unit?,[],[],[],[],[]

When comparing the features on this TV to a similar Samsung you will pay $300-$400 more. I wasn't sure what to expect with this TV and honestly I was ready to dislike it from the start. Now that I've been using mine for about a month I feel I can give a solid review. Sure, this TV is not top of the line, but it has some features you will find on much higher priced sets.Pros- This TV is thin! You can hang it on the wall and it looks like a picture frame on the wall. All the connections are strategically placed that make doing just this possible!- Built in WiFi! I've always hated the idea of having to run a network cable to where I have my TV. It just isn't practical. My PS3 and Xbox are wireless so that's how I've compensated over the past few years. Having the ability to stream without an external source directly from Netfilx or Amazon has made this TV really handy.- The passive 3D has been amazing! I thought I really wanted a TV with active 3D, but the wider viewing angle of the passive 3D and not having to worry about battery powered glasses was a big selling point for me to go passive. Sure the TV snobs will tell you that you are not seeing each frame in Full 1080P with the passive, but we've gotten to the point where the human eye can't even tell so I'm not paying more for something I wouldn't even notice! The 2D to 3D feature is pretty cool too, but the way I'd describe that is that instead of the picture coming out at you, the TV seems to be like a window that you are looking into. The true 3D does come right out of the set at you and I can't believe there isn't more 3D content for how amazing it is to have in your home. The nice thing about the passive 3D is that you just take home your glasses from the latest 3D movie in the theater and they work with your set!- The sound has been impressive. Sure it's not amazing, but I have heard much worse from stock TV speakers. I did hook mine up to surround sound but still use the TV speakers 80% of the time and they have done just fine.Cons:- I'm not sure but I believe this TV only has a single core processor. It's most obvious when searching through the smart TV menus. It just seems like the TV needs more processing power to truly be used as a smart TV that could replace your computer for surfing the web. I've added a wireless logitech keyboard and it has made the smart TV functions so much easier to use! Trying to key in a basic internet search with the stock remote is just down right painful!- Soap Opera Effect (SOE). I've heard many people talk about SOE and Panasonic TVs and didn't understand until I've seen it regularly. It's hard to explain, but some TV shows like Dramas actually look more realistic then they are probably meant to, so they look a lot like the camera movements you would see watching a soap opera. While I've listed this as a Con, it's actually started to grow on me.- No built in camera. The TV has Skype as one of the apps, but without an external camera you can't even use it to make calls. The camera is required to use the app which I don't fully understand. I can make skype calls on my computer without turning the camera on, why can't I do the same on my TV?- The power indicator light is in a horrible location. It is a bright red LED right in the center on the bottom. In a dark room it is so obvious, I don't know why they placed this where they did, but I have noticed I've started blocking it out. At first it was a major annoyance and I almost covered it up with a small piece of tape!I don't think you can find a TV with more features for this price and I am extremely happy with my purchase. I would consider a Panasonic in the future if I am ever looking to upgrade again.Update 11/24/12It truly is a 120 HZ refresh rate set and they get to 360 HZ by playing with the backlighting from what I understand.  In comparing to other sets I would compare this to other 120 HZ sets.  I am not aware how many bits the panel is and I have tried to ind this info without any luck.  I personally have had zero issue with any edge light bleeding.  The edge of my set is perfectly uniform and with the room dark and a dark scene there is no bleed through.  I honestly didn't want to like this set as my fianc&eacute;e picked it as an engagement gift for me and I was looking at samsungs that cost much more.  5 months later we still both love the set and the only thing I wish is that we would have gone bigger than the 42"".  We were even considering upgrading to the 55"" when it was in the Black Friday deal a couple nights ago but I didn't pull the trigger.  Hope this helps!",How is the 3d rendering?,[],[],[],[],[]

Considering the price, I feel like this is a no-brainer purchase if you enjoy streaming shows from Netflix, clips on Youtube, and/or movies out of Google's store.Setup was a little more complicated than I was expecting.  I have a dual-band router, both with the same hidden SSID.  The Chromecast has an option to enter in your hidden SSID so it seemed like there'd be zero issue.  Entered it correctly, verified, and it just couldn't find my network.  I went back and tried a few times, thinking I must have been fat-fingering a button.  No luck.  I un-hid my 5ghz SSID, tried connecting, no luck.  It only worked after exposing the SSID on both 2.4 and 5ghz bands before it would connect.  Somewhere on the device page it says it does work with 2.4ghz hidden SSIDs, and I may try re-naming that band and hiding the 5ghz again.  But I hear that's not actually too terrible a thing to break through if somebody's actually seeking to get in so I might not even worry about it.Anyway, once setup, it's worked great with my HTC One.  Finding content through Netflix, Google Play, and Youtube on your phone is so much more convenient and intuitive than searching on the apps on your TV, or 360, etc.  Basically - any box where you have to fumble with a remote to do searching and navigation, this is better than.  You kick off a movie/clip, cast it to your TV, and the phone is free to do whatever else you want while the content plays.  At any time you can get back into the casting app and pause/resume content.  Super slick.I tried out the casting extension on my chrome browser, and it works about like you'd expect.  You can cast a tab, and all content on that tab is sent to your TV.  Works reasonably well for me, and I can definitely see the use cases (photo sharing, watching things you can't get to through the other mediums you have).  I tried streaming a movie through my Amazon Prime account, and while it worked, the audio wasn't 100% synced up.  And of course if you want it full-screen, you have to give up your laptop while the movie plays.  Also - my laptop (retina MBP) got really hot, and really noisy.  My recommendation would be to not expect to use this feature on a regular basis for streaming content.One other downside I noticed is that while casting a netflix movie, the netflix screen takes up the entirety of my lock screen.  I received a phone call, and the phone was ringing but the caller information was missing, as were the 'Answer' and 'Ignore' buttons.  Had to ""back"" out of the netflix info (which is just weird on the lock screen to have to do) before they showed up.  Google Play Movies did not have this problem, yet still allowed you to pause/resume from the lock screen.Anyway - I really can't recommend this thing enough.  It isn't perfect, but it's also not expensive enough to expect perfection.  If you like Netflix, Youtube, and Google Play content to be on your TV, this is the easiest and cheapest way to get it there.  If you have other ways to get it there, this is still a worthy investment as it's infinitely more pleasing to use than a TV-remote based application.Very, very pleased.",How is the video quality for this gaming system?,[],[],[],[],[]

The bottom line for me is that the iPad has some strong points but, overall, is very limited in its usefulness. It might be well suited for someone in different circumstances but my scenario is that I have a small work laptop that is with me all day and I have a pocketable iPhone which is with me (almost) at all times. At home, I have the work laptop, another laptop and a desktop.Strengths* The iPad is a good digital photo frame. Not worlds better than others you can get, but it's good.* The iPad's greatest strength is with magazines. Magazines have never looked better than on an iPad, particularly photo-oriented magazines covering travel, sports or food. It is materially better than reading a physical magazine. For this purpose I might have wanted the iPad to be even bigger.* The iPad is a nicely compact tablet for web searches. You can do web searches, the page is bigger than your iPhone and the device doesn't take much room on the counter. That's handy.Weaknesses* The iPad does not replace a computer (or any other device). It is meant as a satellite device for people who have laptops, so for instance it doesn't have USB ports to load content directly onto the device. When we went on a trip we wanted to take the iPad instead of a laptop but we couldn't because you can't offload your pics from your camera directly to the iPad. Also, it is in my view not a good word processing platform, or in any case not as good as a compact laptop, so if you need to do actual work you still need your actual laptop. Bottom line: it is a ""third device,"" not a replacement for one of your current devices.* It is not really portable (for men). It doesn't fit in your pocket, so the average man (who doesn't carry a purse) will be leaving it at home.* It doesn't support Flash. The reality is that Flash is all over the web, so if your browser doesn't support it, it's inconvenient.* I can't imagine when I would watch a video on it. If I'm out and about I might watch a YouTube link on my iPhone. But if I am at home I'm sure I would rather watch on my internet-connected TV or on one of my PCs (all of which have larger screens). If I am traveling I probably wouldn't bring the iPad anyway.So for me the iPad is a niche device solving a small set of problems not well addressed by the iPhone-laptop combination, basically for reading magazines and doing the occasional web search. That's fine, but I am not sure it is worth $500-$800. It depends how flush you are I guess. Listening to music on the go is a mass market desire, as we saw with Walkman and later the iPod. Reading backlit magazines and having another way to do searches in the house are much more limited use cases. 3 million Apple fans have bought the device (including myself), but I will be surprised if it becomes a real mass market solution.",How is the processor?,[],[],[],[],[]

Playing with the incredibly small Canon SD780 for a few days, it's a good time to take a step back and recognize the amazing technology which has come to us through the digital revolution. There is simply no comparison to the photographic capability which one can now carry hardly noticed in a shirt pocket, including taking high def VIDEOS! Decent pictures at ISO 800 or even 1600. Amazing. Also, Canon listen to customer feedback; their menus and interfaces are simpler and cleaner than some of the other makers. Finally, the price is really very low for the sophistication that goes into one of these babies - the equivalent of about forty bucks in 1970's dollars when the first compact cameras hit the market at much higher prices.There is only one downside - this camera is so small, and the sensor is so small, that 12MP is too many for top picture quality. I would have voted for fewer pixels, 8 MP instead of 12MP - and get lower noise in return. The exposure sometimes leaves blownout highlights. If absolute image quality is your top priority, there may be other Canon's to look at. But if you're not that picky, the results are excellent. The video function works well and I use it all the time since I find a short movie (a few seconds) is a better remembrance of an event than a still photo. Forty three minutes of High Def video on an 8GB card, so who needs a camcorder?Bottom line; The best camera is obviously the one you have with you.

We use our Hero for taking video of skiing, rafting, body boarding, and getting underwater images.  So we were excited to give the Hero 3 a try.  The Hero 2 is a great camera, and the Hero 3 follows in that tradition, but the redesign has resulted in a few problem areas.  Below are the pros and cons after nearly four weeks of use:Pros-  It is perhaps 30% thinner than the Hero 2.  The slim form factor is immediately noticeable and welcome.  I always felt the 2 was too bulky.- Using the menu system is about the same.  That is, you use a pair of buttons to navigate through a series of two-level menus.  Your options show up on the small LCD screen on the front of the Hero.  The great thing about the Hero 3 Black Edition is that you can control the menus via a mobile iOS app over WiFi.  The app greatly enhances the the ease of use of the Hero 3.  If you don't  use the app (or the add-on LCD screen), be sure you practice navigating the menus and understanding the camera's features before you use it.  The menu and features are moderately intuitive but we need to refer to the user's manual for one-off features.- The WiFi on the Black version is great.  As mentioned before, the iOS app let's you change the camera's settings, but it also allows you to preview what the camera sees without having to buy the $70 LCD add-on.  Using the WiFi feature was very easy and makes this camera worth the price.  You can remotely start recording set the recording features (resolution, time lapse, etc.)  The Black edition also comes with a rechargeable wireless remote that replicates the small monochrome LCD screen on the Hero 3. You can navigate the two-level menu on your remote like you would on the Hero 3 itself.- The quality of the captured video is amazing.  You can select resolutions from VGA through 4k cinema quality.  We use ours at HD resolution and get great results.  The lens is wide angle, so you capture all of the action.- The camera is very versatile.  One of our favorite features is the looping feature that allows the camera to loop back over itself.- You can save your video in RAW camera format to do significant post-processing.  This is a great feature for pros.  It also has a ""Protune"" feature that records at 24 fpm (a TV standard).- You can take photos while it records video.  This feature works great, giving us clear wide-angle shots.- The LCD and extra battery pack that we used with our Hero 2 also work with the Hero 3CONS- The camera is fast and responsive, but a couple of times the camera has frozen while I'm paging through menus.  I have the latest firmware update, so maybe another one is needed by GoPro.  We have to shutdown the camera to unfreeze it.- The sound is decent, but not super-clear.  GoPro makes it clear that using the waterproof case will muffle the sound.  Well, that's the price you pay for a waterproof case.  With the standard case, the sound is better.  Without a case, the sound is very acceptable (but it still doesn't match the quality of the video).  We have not tried out the external mic, but it wold be a good idea to use it if great sound is important to you.- The battery life is only about two hours in our best case.  A second battery would a good idea.CONCLUSIONA great camera.  It is the first generation of an overhaul, so you might well-served waiting for the Hero 4, but the Hero 3 really is a good choice if you want to get your adventures on film.  We love using it for filming wildlife (using the MiFi iOS app), on rollercoasters, etc.  THe positives definitely outweigh the negatives.

Let me keep this simple. I don't have a netflix account neither i use google video&music.; I watch some youtubes but those are short clips. I do watch amazon prime videos but no chromecast apps are available for that. Still, as you know, these is a way though.When you set up your chromecast, wifi connection is required even if you are using the wired lan cable. Here is the point.WIFI IS NOT REQUIRED AFTER THE INITIAL SETUP.The reason casting your chrome browser lags is this. When casting youtube, it's pretty much the dongle that is doing most of the job. That's why it works great. However, when you casting your browser, two way traffics are going on. That's why it lags. Most wireless connections are slower than wired lan. Well some hi-tech wireless would certainly beat wired but that's not for many of us. Then, if we can make at least one way faster, we can assume that casting with your browser would be much better.(I assume you know how to do it. 1)Get the chrome browser for PC 2) download the extension named as google cast 3) put folder's path on the browser 4) browse and run the file 5) click the extension on the right top and cast 6)if you are just casting the screen of your chrome then you don't need 3)and4))Okay, once I set up, I took off my wifi usb adapter for my desktop and connect it with lan cable. Nothing fancy, just a simple cat5e cable. Do I have an expensive router? No way. Mine is refurbished Cisco Valet M20. Got it less than $20.My computer is a bit high-tech. But I assume it doesn't matter since my laptop returned the same result.The difference is huge. With two-way WIFI, I can't even make it with high 720p option on the chrome browser. The amazon video lags so bad that I had to set it to 480p. Playing local video files was worse. I played 2 gb 720p mkv file just FYI.With wired and WIFI, it works great. I would say it's 90% perfect. With wired cable, I can set it to extreme 720p and it still works great. NO lags whatsoever. amazon prime videos or local media files. Since I don't have 1080p files in my HDD, I couldn't test it. However, 720p mkv file worked just great. This means ANY STREAMING on your PC chrome will cast to your tv with the dongle without lagging. hulu, hbo, vemeo.. you just name it.I know the chromcast app on your PC will still ask for wifi connection. However, it works without it as long as you are connected to the same router.Well, hope this helps for those non-netflix users but still thinking about buying this.",How are the people like?,[],[],[],[],[]

This is a pretty crucial difference.I'm going to basically jump into pros and cons, then conclude. I will compare to theMonster ClarityHD Precision Micro Bluetooth Speaker 100 Portable Bluetooth Speaker (MBL CLY SPKR BT)at some points.Pros:-Great design, looks fantastic (I like all the colors except red, but I really liked the ""grill"" on the grey one).-Very minimalistic, simple, and elegant. Follows an ""Apple"" product theme. It has only 3 buttons, and the on/off switch.-Sound Quality is good. This is a small speaker so its never going to be amazing, but I find it rather good for the size. This speaker shines in having good High/Lows, a very rich sound, and really good Bass. In comparison to the Clarity HD which I also tried, the sound is much richer. Though the Clarity HD does indeed have good clarity, the Jambox is as good in that sense as well.-Very easy to use, pairing is incredible fast and simple (after I got it out of the box it was paired in maybe 15 seconds).-Has a website where you can download some small features (kind of useless) but also new firmware and technology that is improving the sound of the Jambox such as ""Live Audio"". Live Audio (i think) separates the Left and Right more and I do indeed think it improves the sound, but it comes at the cost of having a lower Maximum volume. More on volume below.-10 hour battery life. I never actually checked this and I seriously doubt it's 10 hours, but it's much higher advertised than the other bluetooth speakers, so it's safe to assume that the batterlife even if not 10 hours, is still much longer than other speakers like the Clarity HD.Cons:-Loudness. I think the loudness of this speaker is mis-advertised as I was a little bit dissapointed. At home, this thing is great. Easily fills my room, and when I turned it up downstairs, you could still hear it Upstairs in different rooms. If you want the better sound with Live Audio, it is ~2-3 volume levels (Clicks of the button) less, so it is quite a bit. When I took this to a social function with about 15 people all in a room, you could hardly hear some songs when people were talking. This also however depends on the song itself. I think if you were to turn up most songs in Itunes (Volume wise) above 100%, they would still sound good (not distorted). So I hope that the volume cap is put higher in a update (which is why updates are a very nice feature). The Clarity HD gets much louder, but once again the sound is a lot worse. If volume is crucial for you, the Clarity HD might be a nice option (Check out my review on it). Overall I think most people are going to be satisfied with the volume, and if you really need a boost, you can connect the device by wire and the sound gets MUCH louder, as loud if not louder than the Clarity HD on bluetooth.Edit: Along with LiveAudio, there is also a feature called ""Sound Clarity"" which once again, says it will improve audio sound at the cost of some volume, when LiveAudio is DISabled. So I had both these features enabled therefore I didn't have maximum sound. So this device CAN get a little bit louder than I thought. I still think the choice between volume and sound quality is a nice one, however to change this you need to connect to a computer, so this cannot be easily shifted on the go.-Price, $200 is a lot but the market for these devices is quite high as it is. The Clarity HD is twice as cheap on Amazon right now, but as i said before, I got my Jambox for $150 so that made a huge difference in my mind. For $50 more, I would hands down prefer the Jambox over Clarity HD. For $100, the question becomes more clouded. If you have the money and are willing to spend it, you will not feel bad about spending $150 as I think you will be very satisfied with the Jambox, it's just got a pleasing feel to it.(This isn't really a con, but a concern) -Portability: Im not certain how portable this is. Its really small and easy to carry but you do need some kind of bag, as its awkward to just carry in your hand. You do get a nice case with it. The best option without an extra bag is I guess a decently big jacket pocket would fit it. It is portable but I think its kind of peculiar to carry around, if you have Purse or some kind of backpack or anything, that problem is dissolved.Conclusion: This is a great product though it is quite pricey. It has really good sound quality and bass for its size and purpose. I am concerned about how loud this could get in a very loud enviornment, but I suspect for most people, it will be good enough. The firmware updates make this kind of problem solvable, and leave the Jambox with room to improve. The design and features are really nice. Compared to the Clarity HD, I think the reviews are misleading. The Clarity HD has notable MUCH worse sound quality, but it does get louder and is cheaper. The firmware updates are a nice touch and give you options for better sound, which is also very nice. In every other aspect such as design and battery life, the Jambox is also supreme.Extra-Topical: My Jambox is actually going to be RMA'd beacuse it has some kind of glitch or is defective, but a few times, the Bluetooth connection would just be a random sound, like a signal, but it wouldnt play any music and would make weird crackling sounds. The wire would still play music however. Recently I could barely even get bluetooth to play music, rather than these weird sounds as if it were broken, so this is a big problem. I am hoping this is just my unit so its not impacting the review, but if my new one has this problem, I may make an edit.Also, this isnt really a connectivity drop because it isnt silence, its this weird droning noise. But on the topic of connectivity. Ive never had a drop on my Itouch even while walking downstairs which the Jambox is upstairs. However, my sisters IPhone 4G had like 4 drops in one session of listening. Im not really sure what caused the connection loss and I dont know if its specific to the Iphone 4G but this may be a problem. Never happend to me though.",Is sound clear?,['switch.-Sound Quality is good.' 'switch.-Sound Quality is good'],[543 543],[2 2],[0.6 0.6],[ True  True]

I knew the Sennheiser name so felt I would be on the right track.  I have 3 pair of headphones.  A pair I bought at Radio Shack 5 years ago for $27 (bedroom), which died and is the reason for my purchase.  I also have the Sony headphones for $150 (TV room).  These cost $75 (bedroom).  My $27 headphones were the best in every way; sound, no problems, always worked.  Radio Shack no longer has the headphones.  When I first got the Senn headphones they worked 50% of the time and it was very frustrating.  We found out that when we had them plugged into the back of the TV (brand new LCD TV), that was the reason for them working only 50% of the time but when we plugged them into the back of our DVR, they work 100% of the time and we have had no more problems.  The only thing I don't like about these headphones is that they are not comfortable and fall of my head easily.  I didn't know they weren't the type that covers the whole ear.  The type that covers the whole ear are the most comfortable and the sound is better because your ear is encased.  Also they don't fall off.  When I'm sitting in bed watching TV with my head against a couple of pillows, it moves these headphones forward slightly off my ears and the sound is not as loud.  As for recommending these headphones, I would say get the headphones that cover the ear whatever brand.",Does the sound fantastic?,"['sound, no problems']",[388],[2],[0.4],[False]

I chose this router based upon capabilities and power.  I had to return the first one I received as it &#8220;bricked&#8221; when downloading the firmware update.  But, the replacement worked just fine and I will detail how that went.I made the decision to contact ASUS to have them walk me through the complete process (never did this before &#8211; always did it on my own).  In reality, I did not need their assistance until the end of the setup where it asks me to update the firmware.  I was advised to download it to the computer (on the desktop makes the most sense so you can easily find it later) and update it manually once the remaining steps are completed.I then accessed the router and manually updated the firmware.  The process was fairly simple and was completed quickly.  With the exception of the initial firmware issue &#8211; which is the reason for 4 stars versus 5 &#8211; I have been very happy with the router.  Having the USB ports have been great (attached a printer and an external hard drive) and the coverage has been excellent.I do think this is an excellent router &#8211; once you get past the firmware issue.  It does have great coverage with powerful coverage.  As I noted above, the USB ports have been nice to make further use of the router.

Here is what I like about it.1.  The USM gives me better auto-focus performance.  Worth the price diff between the f1.8?  ... I'm guessing not, but on the other hand, candids of two active boys might be helped by a speedier auto-focus.2. The f/1.4 gives me a noticable margin for low light situations3. The f/1.4 version is slightly better built and does produce better bokeh than the cheaper f/1.8 models.Here is what I dont like1. I have noticed that the lens is very soft on the wide end between 1.4 and 1.8. There is some kind of ""flaring"" around the bright spots.2. I have taken identical photos with my L17-40 f4 and dont see this. Although the 50/1.4 is a lot faster than my L lens.. I am sending this lens back either to Canon for calibration or to Amazon..3. The ring of the 50/1.4 appears to be loose. I dont know if this is supposed to be this way.. however for an expensive lens Canon should construct this lens like a tank. but no.. it appears to be cheap.4. The 50mm/1.8 is only about $70 so it's hard to beat. I find the picture quality is around the the same as my 50/1.4.",How do the lenses work?,[],[],[],[],[]
