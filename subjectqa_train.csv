I finally caved and purchased a Fire HDX to use with this keyboard. Absolutely love it and the case. The case has openings for the on/off and volume buttons, as well as the camera lens. The Fire stays nicely propped on the pillow on my lap and the keyboard is very easy to use, with the added plus of less hands on the screen itself = less build up needing to be wiped off. Especially after buttered popcorn...That was something that I feared, having last year's model - nothing being marketed now fits my Fire. I was sure I studied the product page carefully prior to selecting it as a vine option, and I didn't see anywhere that said *Kindle HDs will not fit this case* (I do so appreciate those manufacturers who do that), so I decided to give this a go.OK, so bummer my Fire is too big to fit in the nifty little holder (pouts). But...the keyboard still works great, I just use it as a separate piece in my lap with the Fire on the other side. The keys are very easy to strike, as opposed to how hard I have to bang on the keys on the Acer laptop to make sure I don't miss letters and have to backtrack. That said, this doesn't quite replace the typing experience from a *real* keyboard and sitting at the desktop - but then I'm from the old school of proper typing on a proper typewriter (ya'll remember IBM Selectrics?). As nice as this keyboard is, you're just not going to get the speed you're used to and using the ASDF JKL; they used to teach in school - and definitely not trying to work the keyboard on your lap whilst trying to type with both hands like I was taught. Very handy for quick comments on FB or Goodreads, etc., I like it a lot more than the Fire virtual keyboard.As for setup and the too-brief instructions, I charged the keyboard but then felt completely lost on item #2 to turn on Bluetooth. Silly me, I didn't realize that was something I had to turn on on the Fire and not a switch on the keyboard that I couldn't find.

While I don't get into the realm of the insanely expensive professional monitors, I really appreciate a good IPS/PLS monitor. And here's another one.Surprisingly, getting the monitor out of the box wasn't as easy as I'd have hoped. The stem of the monitor (the part that attaches to the stand) is sort of wedged (gently!) against a piece of foam, so it took a little bit of wiggling to get the screen out. If you have someone to help, this would go much more easily!Putting the monitor on the stand took just a few seconds. It hand-screws in, and has a very solid base. It's also an extremely ugly, huge base, and absolutely my one major gripe with the monitor.But let's focus on the good stuff first:For reference, this was tested on a 2011 MacBook Air via mini-Displayport to Displayport (2560x1440), and with a Google Chromecast via HDMI (1920x1080).1.) Pre-calibrated out of the box. Given that my screen came with a specific-to-this-serial-number piece of paper documenting the factory calibration, I was extremely impressed with the output.2.) The controls on the bottom right of the screen are touch sensitive. Normally I'm not a fan of such buttons, but these are without a doubt the most responsive touch-buttons I've used on a monitor. Really good stuff.3.) The screen isn't matte, and it isn't glossy. It's a really excellent combination of the two, cutting down on the glare of a glossy display, while maintaining those rich colors and good contrast.4.) Viewing angles, like many/most IPS panels, is truly excellent.5.) Able to rotate the screen 90 degrees, and it does line up perfectly straight when locked into that 90-degree position. Also, the height adjustment is superb, with plenty of height for me, and I'm 6'5"".6.) No dead/stuck pixels on the monitor I received. Good!7.) No PWM-dimming flicker (if you're sensitive to this, you'll be glad to know!), and no buzzing or other untoward noises from the display at any brightness.8.) While certainly not specifically a gaming monitor, it definitely holds its own. My gaming monitor of choice is myEIZO Foris FS2333-BK 23-Inch Screen LCD Monitor, but if you want something bigger without the viewing-angle deficiencies of TN panels, this would not be a bad choice for the less hardcore PC gamers among you. I wouldn't recommend it for 1080p gaming since the scaling to 1440p can be quite ugly.9.) You can turn off the blue power LED when the monitor is in use, from the Settings menu. I really don't like unnecessary LEDs, so this is something I immediately looked for and was glad to find.And now, the cons:1.) The base of the stand is horrible. I'm not sure what Viewsonic were thinking, but surely somebody could have come up with something a little less of an eyesore. I'll be mounting the screen on a VESA mount (100x100), but still - ouch! So ugly, and it takes up a huge amount of room on the desk for no apparent reason.2.) The brightness is set far, far too high out of the box (maxed out). All this did was draw attention to a little light bleed on the left of my particular display, only view-able on a completely black image. After the brightness was turned down to a less eye-searing level, this was (mostly) gone.Overall, though, this is a top-notch monitor, and highly recommended.5 stars out of 5.",How is the base?,['has a very solid base' 'a very solid base'],[585 589],[1 1],[0.565 0.565],[ True  True]

(so some of you should stop reading now) The new Nexus 7 really gives the Kindle Fire a run for its money as an entertainment device. I only have one Amazon movie, but use Hulu Plus and NetFlix. Both of those work great on both devices. Come to think of it, I didn't try viewing my Amazon Prime movie on the Nexus. My main use is web browsing, books, music and video files. The new Nexus has speakers that sound pretty much just as nice (and loud) as the KFHD. There might be a difference in screen resolution, but my eyes can't tell - both screens look bright and sharp.Books - Text to speech on Amazon Kindle books only works on the KFHD.

Believe it or not, I side-loaded Chrome on my KFHD some time ago, but I really just use Silk. Silk is fine for my needs.So both are fine devices, so what are the attractions to one over the other?- Nexus 7 has my favorite Google apps - like Google Maps.- Nexus 7 has GPS, which sounds useful, haven't played much with it yet.- Nexus 7 allows multiple user accounts. That will really be handy.- Nexus 7's back facing camera lets you take pictures even it you look funny doing it.- Google Play store has a bajillion apps, 99.9997% of which I don't care about.

BUT, I noticed today that only the 16 gig version of the KFHD is for sale at Amazon. Perhaps Amazon is about to release a new version? Next month could be a different story.There are minor details, like the Nexus needs a special adapter cable for HDMI out where the KFHD uses a separate, ""normal"" socket.

The installer really was a breeze. The free iPhone app also installed quickly and in less than 10 minutes after opening the box I was monitoring my kitchen and living room on my iPhone.Daytime-mode images are nice and crisp, and the night-time images are also very good and seem to have a range well beyond the 15 feet D-Link indicates (perhaps I have more ambient light in my area at night). You can also connect the camera by cable or wifi, but wifi seems to be by far the best choice as then you have much more flexibility as to where to place the camera.Other reviewers have complained that without a recording feature the camera isn't very useful, as you would have to be watching the feed all the time to see if anyone was breaking in, messing with your stuff, etc. However we have a good home alarm system and if it ever went off we would be notified immediately, which would allow me to turn on the app and check the camera right away. The app also includes a photo option, so you can take still photos from the D-Link camera that are saved to your Photos app (on the iPhone/iPad anyway).Two minor issues were 1) the iPhone app sometimes doesn't connect to the camera, and needs to be restarted to get the feed; 2) there is a 2-3 second delay in the feed, so it is almost but not quite ""real time"" (this may be a function of network speed, cell-phone distance, etc.). And of course, should your network go down, the camera is useless. But that almost goes without saying.For the price, this is a good-quality camera.

I spent about $900 including tax to buy it at the Apple store and another ~$60 on ""HD"" apps including the iWork suite: pages, numbers, and keynote.  I do have an iPhone so I already owned a lot of apps that work with the tablet.I have found myself using it mostly for four things: document viewing for work, email, web browsing, and games.I'm a bit ashamed to admit that I've been using it for games, but I have played several and really enjoyed them.  I'm not a ""gamer"" at all.  I own a Wii that only gets used for watching Netflix movies on my television.  Video games are usually boring to me.  There are quite a few games designed for adults filled with puzzles and brain teasers that will change your view of computer games.  No matter who you are or how adult you think you are: you will wind up using this thing for games.  It's too fun to play games on it not to.  I recommend Labyrinth 2 HD, Osmos HD, Pinball HD, tChess Lite, and a good Solitare game.Back to getting work done: it's pretty great for email.  I have a work blackberry and a personal iPhone.  I get lots of spreadsheet and other document attachments.  Blackberry is terrible at displaying documents.  Iphone does an OK job.  This thing is a desktop replacement as a document viewer.  It isn't as good as having MS office on a PC, but you can definitely get a great view of a document with a lot of formatting intact.  It isn't really better than iPhone for viewing messages, but viewing attachments on the big screen is worlds better.  The only complaint I have about email is that it lacks the ability to thread conversations and show all email inboxes in one list like the ios4 iphone devices.  It will have those abilities this fall when it gets upgraded to ios4, but for now switching between inboxes is a bit awkward.More on document viewing.The biggest help to me at work is document viewing.  I can carry promotional materials, examples of past promotions, old communications, files for reference, presentations, price lists, spec sheets, manuals, photos, trade journals, books, and any other digital document imaginable and access them all easily when with a customer or simply to find info to make me more effective.  The iPad does not include a file system like finder or windows explorer.  The iWork apps have a documents folder, but those folders are not accessible by other apps.  All of the apps include a shortcut to open a document in other apps, but not having a universal finder app is annoying.  If you are in mail you can choose to open an attachment in Pages then email any changes back to the person, but it goes against the way we have all become accustomed to working on PCs and Macs.  There are file system and viewer apps.  I've tried two I like and one that I highly recommend: Goodreader.  Goodreader gives you a place to organize your files into folders for various projects and info.  It has viewers for office file formats, PDF files, and limited graphics files (sorry, there are no eps, ai, or similar art viewers for ipad that I've discovered yet).  Goodreader allows you to transfer files to the ipad via wifi networking, wifi using a web browser on a PC or Mac, using the USB cable, or using itunes.  Best thing about Goodreader: it's only one dollar.The built-in photos app is great.  I used my mac to convert a lot of documents to jpgs just so I could use the photos app to view and display them.  Integration between the photos app and the iwork apps and mail is great.  Syncing albums between a Mac or PC and the Photos app is a snap.  The photos app is where the ""magical"" in the ads comes from.  It is a delight to browse images using the app.  I'm sure you can find countless youtube videos demonstrating it if you look.  For under five dollars, you can buy Photogene or a similar app for useful photo editing on the ipad.Web browsing is the other ""killer app.""  Lots of people complain that iPad doesn't support flash, but I honestly don't miss it.  Most big web sites recognize that you're using an ipad and deliver non-flash versions of videos.  My biggest concern is the lack of RAM in the ipad.  The lack of RAM shows when web browsing.  If you switch between open pages, most of those pages will be reloaded because it doesn't cache much; it can't cache much with only 256mb of ram.  As long as switching between pages, and having them reload when doing so isn't a huge issue to you, web browsing on the ipad using Safari is a desktop-like experience.  I have just recently started using a third party browser called ""Atomic Web.""  Atomic web adds useful multitouch gestures, tabs, full screen, and adblock to the Safari browser.  I highly recommend Atomic Web for the $2 they charge for it.  It works great.The app store lets you add tons of functionality to your machine.  Count on spending $50+ depending on what you want to do with your machine.  I love the three $10ea iWork apps, the $5 photo editor, the handful of $5-$10 games I own, and the multitude of free periodical reader apps I downloaded.Watching and listening to media in ipad is really great.  The iPod interface looks like an older version of iTunes on a Mac.  Video looks great.  I've always been a fan of desktop itunes for syncing with ipod and iphone.  Ipad is exactly like iphone and ipod when interacting with the desktop.  The built in speakers in ipad are louder and sound better than iPhone and iPod touch.  They are nearly as loud as the ones on my Macbook Pro 13"".  The speakers are great for listening to podcasts or watching a movie in bed or in your comfy chair.Google maps and google earth are a desktop-like experience on ipad.Battery life is where ipad kicks laptop tail.  I easily get 8+ hours from a charge.Typing on ipad in landscape mode is about like typing on a netbook; you wouldn't want to write a long document on it but it's fine for email and composing short documents and memos.  It's a lot better than I expected.  Typing in portrait mode is a bit of a chore.You WILL need to buy a case for it.  The ""acase"" brand ipad case that sells for $26 here at Amazon is a great choice (and the highest rated case on Amazon).  You will not be able to find an Apple case for it.  Apple cannot meet demand for ipad accessories.  The camera connection kit (usb and card reader) are also impossible to find.I'm glad I bought the largest (64GB) model.  I currently only have 25GB free after putting in 20GB of music, 8GB of films, 5GB of apps, and around 2GB of documents.  64 GB is really very ideal, but anything less would be crowded unless you don't plan to use the ipod or video player much.I bought the 3G service for it and don't regret it.  I live in the midwest and ATT has decent service here.  I am paying $15/month (no contract) for 256MB.  2GB is available for $25/mo.  I bought the cheaper plan because I have frequent access to wifi, but wanted the ability to look at email adn documents on the road if the occasion arises.  So far just using 3G for email and very infrequent browsing 256mb is plenty.  I highly recommend buying a 3G model unless you are sure that you will always have Wifi access when you use it.  It's a lot less useful if you can't connect to the web.In conclusion, this thing is very useful and very expensive.  I use it a lot.  I use my PC and my Mac a lot less now.  I carry it to places that I wouldn't consider lugging a PC to.  It allows me to carry a lot more info and digital files than I ever did before.  It makes me more effective and allows me to travel lighter.  Is it worth slightly over $1000 after buying a case and apps?  I'm still not 100% sure.  Do I love it?  yes.",How many wins do you have in this game?,[],[],[],[],[]

As far as the computers in my house go, this router seems to work just fine.  No problems connecting anywhere in the house.  My problem is with my iOS devices.  My ipad connects just fine and stays connected while in use, but loses it's connection when idle.  I use an alarm clock app at night that displays the weather.  By the time I wake up in the morning, the weather is no longer available because my connection was dropped.

I had never had any hiccups with my previous router, but this one will not connect with any of those three applications.  If I restart the router, I have a short period of time where they will connect before my ipad goes idle, I lose my connection, re-select my network in preferences, and then none of those three will work.

We were just tired of paying for it every month.  I've only had this router for a day, but setup only took seconds.  The setup page is pretty easy to navigate and I had no problems renaming our network, creating a passcode, and forwarding the necessary ports to get my torrent clients up and running.  I don't notice any significant speed increase over a wireless G router, but very few systems are able to utilize the 150mbps this thing is capable of providing.  Anyway, the signal is strong and it's as speedy as expected.I've owned quite a few routers in my day and most of them are pretty straight forward pieces of equipment.  This one receives five stars because it does what it's supposed to and hasn't hickupped so far.  I will update my review in a few months when I have a better idea of durability and quality over time, but I don't foresee any issues.For the price, a GREAT buy, and I highly suggest getting the bundle that Amazon offers with this modem:Motorola SB6120 SURFboard DOCSIS 3.0 eXtreme Broadband Cable Modem.

It holds the laptop at a convenient angle and makes it all the easier to use the keypad or touchpad.  Cooling efficiency is excellent with the two fans - our Lenovo and HP laptops can get a bit warm on the bottom but I found that they stay absolutely cool when on the stand.The fans are powered from a dual USB plug that lets you piggy-back any other device on it so you don't lose a USB port when the fans are plugged in.  The fans can get noisy if they accumulate a lot of dust BUT they easily snap out for cleaning - and you can reconfigure them by snapping them back in virtually anywhere under the stand. This is a really good design because you can reposition one or both to specifically cool off the battery compartment or CPU no matter where it's located in the laptop. The stand is also very light and has rubber non-skid feet and rubber pads on top so that laptop doesn't move around.Well worth five stars.,Is usb port working?,[],[],[],[],[]

As others have stated, the PS4 was in a box with one layer of air packs on TOP of the package!  That leaves the bottom and all 4 sides completely unprotected against shock.  Big thumbs down for Amazon's packaging and delayed shipping.That said, the item did arrive with no damage and mine powers up and runs with no issues.  Played about 3 hours of gaming so far and it doesn't seem to overheat or have any other issues.  Took about an hour to figure out that DD 5.1 doesn't work out the optical output unless you check HDMI as ""primary"".  Go figure.  Seems like a bug.  As soon as I switched to HDMI as the primary sound output, the *optical* out started working and delivered 5.1 to my receiver.As a console, I'd have to call this a PS 3.1 instead of a PS4.  The OS operates very much like the PS3 and it just feels like I replaced my PS3.  Lots of pixels and nice graphics but on the one game I've played so far (Killzone) it's not a blow-you-away feeling.  The purchase has honestly left me feeling like I should have waited for the Xbox One in 4 more days.  Really nothing new here.  It's basically a PS3 with more pixels.  No new innovations to take your gaming to the next level like a next gen Kinect BUT the one high point I'd have to say is the controller.  The smoothness and linearity are quite impressive.  Still, I'd MUCH prefer that they have AA batteries that I can just replace when needed (like the Xbox) rather than needing to leave my $400 console on to charge the controllers!UPDATE: Well, I got an Xbox One and let me tell you, compared to the Xbox One, the PS4 shines so I updated this review to 4 stars!  I'll keep both because I like some of the exclusive games on both consoles but the PS4 controller is more amazing each time you use it.  The Xbox One controller feels like a whale's tail in comparison.  The thing that sends me over the top is that there is one game I can't stop playing: Resogun!  IMO, this is the only game on either console right now (early December 2013) worth playing!  And playing.  And playing.",How is the build quality?,[],[],[],[],[]

My old D-Link DIR-615 was fast enough but I was never really happy with the wireless coverage. We have a 2 story home and as long as you were on the same floor, you were OK, but the other floor was spotty at best.The other problem I had with the old router was the limited number of concurrent connections it supported. As the number of wireless devices increased in the house (smart phones, iPods, several laptops, an E-reader, the Wii... you get the picture) I started getting complaints about dropped connections and/or the router being frozen.After researching what was available and working well for others, I settled on the Asus RT-N56U. The Asus has all the features I need such as high concurrent connection limits and extended range in the 2.4 GHz band (the band I use with my work laptop).So far, I couldn't be happier. The unit was easy to setup and plugged into my home network (wired and wireless) with zero issues. My work laptop now gets 5 bar - excellent coverage on both floors of my home and we have no issues with dropped connections or router hangs.We have connected the following wireless devices to the Asus with no issues:- iPhone 4s- Motorola Atrix- Blackberry Bold- iPod touch- Epson Workforce635- MacBook Pro (uses the 5 Ghz band)- Dell laptops (Win xp and Win 7)- Nook color- Wii- Samsung Blu-ray- Asus TF300 Tablet- Nokia Lumina 900- iPhone 5- iPad miniThe unit came with an older firmware, but it was painless to upgrade to the latest. I simply downloaded the latest firmware from Asus to a PC and then upgraded the router via the admin web interface.My only complaint is the bandwidth graphs don't show traffic by device. Instead, you can see the traffic by total, wired, 2.4 GHz wireless and 5 GHz wireless.One final note. I use the Cisco VPN client on my laptop to connect to the office  and it has worked flawlessly since day 1. No changes required to the client, work or the router.Update 6/11/12Just a quick update to add a couple of new devices that work flawlessly with the Asus router.

This router still rocks and delivers consistent performance despite the growing load.Update 6/22/13Another quick update to add/change devices. My wife replaced her Atrix with an iPhone 5. The iPhone 5 supports both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands. She is using it on the 2.4 band. We also added an iPad mini to the mix so the kids will let me use my Asus tablet.

What Chromecast does is to cast ""cast-supported"" apps from your smart phones, tablets, and stream media from your laptops and PCs to the TV on the same local network (LAN).Setup is easy and straight-forward. Connect Chromecast to your TV, download Chromecast apps from Google Play / iTune to your device, making sure Wifi-is on, setup Chromecast's Wifi connection via your mobile device, and it is done. Setup only needs to be done once. Other supported devices connected to the same local network will then all be able to use the same Chromecast.Now Google Play has a section dedicated to Chromecast compatible apps. For some reason, this section is only shown via Google Play app, not browser version, but going to chromcast.com/apps would also give you the list. Currently the selection is quite limited, with a great deal of them just variations of apps for streaming media from your local computers and media servers to Chromecast. Others like YouTube, Netflix, Hulu, and so on frequently requires paid subscription to truly make a difference.Basically, Chromecast combines your mobile device and TV into a fast-response SmartTV.The Touch-Ups which could potentially make Chromecast a perfect device:Currently, the only way to cast PC Desktop screens onto Chromecasted TV is to download the Google Chrome extension ""Google Cast"" by Google (sorry, mobile Google Chrome is currently not supported). It gives your the option to stream a dedicated browser Tab or cast the entire desktop screen. However, there are some flaws:1. In general, casting would mess up your Google Chrome ""non-maxed"" window size. It is a mild annoyance, but still annoying anyhow.2. Tab cast mode has no option to display mouse cursor. Not an issue for portable laptops, but a serious issue for a casting PC from another room.3. Desktop cast mode does display mouse cursor, but it could only cast the whole desktop. If you have a multiple monitor setup, it practically makes the cast useless.4. Neither Tab mode nor Desktop mode have build-in PC control mechanism. Although this could be easily fixed by using app such as ""Unified Remote,"" it is still one extra step.*How 4. works, Google Cast to cast PC desktop + Unified Remote on your tablet/smart phone to control the PC -> result displays on TV**Better solution: Chomecast app integrates with Google Cast.

The midrange and bass are good.  But the high ends are completely disappointing.  Is that hole at the top of the speakers a tweeter or just a decoration?  Either way, the high ranges are lacking -- no crispness at all.The net result sounds like it does with water in my ears, or when your ears don't pop during an airplane landing.  There is no treble control to fix the high ends, though the bass control lets you set the 'woofer at whatever level you want.Fortunately, my computer sound card has an equalizer that lets you change the sound.  With one of the sound profiles (""jazz"") the sound is tolerable, so I won't be sending these back.

It looks well built. The cable is thick, yet flexible. The end fits snugly. It's cheap. It works.I was at Best Buy the other day and saw a HDMI cable for almost $200. Yep, you read right. $200. That's $100 per meter. That's as much as forty foot longs at Subway, or a 1994 Ford Aspire. My videophile friend tells me that high-priced HDMI cables are better than cheap ones, since it's expensive to make 99.99% deoxygenated wire, which apparently prevents degradation of the signal.Who knew that oxygen degraded a digital signal? Too much oxygen also probably destroys the Higgs bosons in the cheap HDMI cable, which is probably why I cannot view my Blu-rays in the 2160P that my videophile friend's expensive HDMI cable allows. I told him he should buy theDiamond HDMI Digital Audio/Video Cable W/ Ethernet Connection (5M)for a bargain $2694.75 (at the time of this review), but for some reason he hung up on me.I did consider buying the Audioquest Diamond HDMI cable myself since a simple exercise in logic determined that this cable would be approximately 450 times better than the BlueRigger HDMI cable ($5.99), right?

Skullcandy will replace them for any reason, whenever - just go to their website, register your product, and fill out the warranty form.  You will receive CREDIT for their website that you can use on whatever you like, as well as free shipping.  The amount of credit will depend upon the current price of your product on THEIR website - so for the standard INK'D buds, you will get a $20 credit.  You do not need any proof of purchase, and it does not matter how much time has passed - just pop the broken buds into a small envelope and you're good.Firstly, I want to mention a few important tidbits that you should know.1.  Pay attention to the L and R (engraved on the stem) on these earbuds, which can be hard to see.  Do not reverse them, as doing so can affect fit and sound quality.  I find putting a piece of colored tape on the right cord makes life easier.2.  Don't assume you know which gel size will fit you best; make sure you try on all 3 gel sizes that come with these, as using the wrong size can dramatically decrease sound quality and comfort.  If your earbuds are uncomfortable or the sound quality does not meet your expectations, then you likely have the wrong size gel installed.  For myself, I automatically went with the smallest size because my ears are small, but those made the earbuds sound like cheap garbage.  It wasn't until I tried the next size up did I get the full quality of sound that these are designed for.  So pay attention to this, since it really matters.3.  These have a straight plug, not an L-shaped plug.  So you will need to be extra careful as a straight-plug design increases the amount of pressure both on the plug, and the headphone jack of your player.  This leads to frayed wires or a loosening of the headphone jack, or both, which ultimately lead to the classic problem of only one side having sound.4.  The cord is long - measures approximately 4 feet, 5 inches.5.  Burn-in works with these.  Slightly.Now, as for the build quality - I'm impressed.  They are not cheaply made earbuds, despite their low price.  The wires are nice and solid, and feel very well made - not flimsy or plastic-y.  The silicone gels (tips that go in your ear) are very soft and pliable, and even have the Skullcandy logo engraved on them.  Nice touch.They feel good, too.  Really good.  Both the material, and the way they fit my annoyingly small ears.  And they don't fall out constantly, although I do sometimes get the sensation that it's getting sucked into my left ear.And yes, these come with 3 different size gels.Sound is great.  These handle bass extremely well for mid-tier earbuds, and highs aren't so shrill and piercing as with other comparable brands.  Some of this really depends on your player, too.  Even between iPods, sound quality does differ.As far as functionality goes, I find I am able to run with these with no problem.  The wires do not get tangled, and you can easily adjust the split in them with an attached slider (that has 'Skullcandy' written on it in the corresponding colour), which I find very convenient.  I do not hear this thumping sound that others claim to hear from wire-movement, so I can't confirm that.The only things I dislike are the straight plug, and the lack of a case.  Otherwise, I am thoroughly impressed with Skullcandy.  The craftsmanship, the quality of sound, and all the little extras that Skullcandy does that really lets you know that they are paying attention, and that they care about their products and end-users.Worth every penny.UPDATE 12/31/2011 - My current pair has seen daily use for over a year now with no issues.",How is the cord?,[],[],[],[],[]

For the past two years we've been using a VueZone system, but recently upgraded to a 10Mb Internet connection so wanted to try a full-frame-rate IP camera with pan, tilt, and zoom capabilities.  The results were disappointing across the board:1. Poor depth-of-field.2. Smeared look to movement.3. Weak Wi-Fi reception.4. Slow response to pan, tilt, and zoom controls.5. Non-existent Tech Support6. Java requirement.Depth-of-Field--------------The image looked fuzzy at certain distances, so I placed it at the end of a 20' hallway and systematically adjusted the lens to find a focal point that would work for all distances near and far.  Never could.  Interestingly, our VueZone camera whose lens is non-adjustable has no difficulty keeping everything in focus.Smeared Movement----------------Compared to YouTube examples--and an understanding of how 30fps should look--our results disappointed.  They were certainly an improvement over the 4fps of our VueZone cameras, but not what 30fps should look like IMHO.  Looked somewhere between those two numbers.Weak Wi-Fi----------One of the big selling points of today's IP cameras is their use of Wi-Fi.  Surprisingly, this camera would not connect much beyond 15' and passing through one wall.  Found this surprising because our VueZone cameras sit 20' feet away and pass through two walls without problem.  One camera is 30' away and passes through three walls one of which is brick.  All the more surprising when you consider the DCS-5020L can act as a wireless extender.Slow Response-------------Pan, tilt, and zoom controls had a 2-4 second delay.  That's not horrible but borders on it.  Again, does not match what people post in YouTube reviews.Tech Support------------DLink has enjoyed a strong reputation for consumer tech products ever since its early success in routers.  So, I was surprised to learn their technical support consisted of FAQ pages on their web site.And, if you click on Contact Us you are taken to a content-management system where you type in your question and it does it's best to find an answer other owners have rated as ""helpful"" in the past.Pretty lame.  Again, using VueZone as our point of reference, at least with them you can call and talk to a person.Java Requirement----------------Simply put, if you use the myDlink web site to access your camera you gotta have Java enabled.  And, since 2011 Java is known to be one of the biggest malware vectors on the Net.  Apple quit shipping products with it pre-installed right after that announcement.Conclusion----------On the plus side, the camera is attractively designed, quiet when tilted or panned, and incorporates an IR-cut filter.  Unfortunately it fails in the critical areas of providing a clear image with reasonable Wi-Fi range.  For that and the reasons outlined above, it will be returned for a refund.

WIth the latter, I used the keyboard infrequently however every time that I went to use it, I took a considerable number errors and miskeys until I got into the swing of it. My opinion is that the keys are just to close together on the keyboard and hence I regularly ended up pushing both adjacent keys.Enter the Airbender. The first thing I notice, and looked for, was a tad of spacing between the keys and was pleased to see it. This is achieved I feel by reducing the size of the keys from 16mm on the Logitech to 14mm on the Airbender. Hence there is, in my opinion,  just enough space to allow me to type without constant errors. I did find that the right shift key was a little awkwardly spaced to the right of the ""page up"" key and it is a little small, however with time I am sure I will get used to it.As previously mentioned by other reviewers, the clamshell mechanism is a little fiddly to get it situated however, when it is finally set up, bingo! I especially like the way it can be either landscape or portrait or anything in-between if you so desire unlike other clamshells on the market. The ability to be able to detach the iPad quickly from the keyboard is ingenious and useful although I did, again, find it a little fiddly re-attaching however I am sure practice will make perfect. Compared to the Logictech which, when the iPad is stowed away, is very sleek and has a nice look due to the aluminum case, the Airbender is a little more bulky however the practicality of the product outweighs the negative of this feature.I think I read that it was not possible to charge the iPad while the case is closed however mine seems to be able to do this without a problem. I also read that the auto off function using, I presume, magnets was spotty and I have to say I have also found this. That being said, I usually manually switch off my iPad and keyboard prior to closing the case so it is not an issue. In the case that I do forget, hopefully the timer auto off will work however I am not sure if this will happen if the case is linked with the bluetooth keyboard. Either way, this is certainly not a big issue in my mind.All in all, I think this is a well designed and thought out case. It is exactly what I needed and , although bulkier than the Logictech, I am very pleased I purchased it. I would definitely recommend it to anyone that wants the benefit of a true keyboard as opposed to the screen keyboard.",What do you think of the artistic design?,"['WIth the latter, I used the keyboard infrequently however every time that I went to use it']",[200],[1],[0.],[False]

It controls the iPad very well with its dedicated macro buttons.Being able to swivel the iPad is very useful in situations where you'd like to type in portrait mode. Being able to disconnect the iPad from the keyboard is very useful and the case has proven to be very helpful. Don't trust it to protect it from a drop but it certainly is better than nothing. And the overall battery life is very good. I didn't find myself charging it too often honestly, which shocked me.ConThe Preview photo button seems to have absolutely no use. It will unlock the iPad but doesn't open anything and while the iPad is unlocked it does nothing. It just seems redundant as there is an unlock button already.The page up and down buttons don't seem to work in safari, nor any other browser I've tried. There might be other apps where they work but I haven't found them yet. Disconnecting the iPad from the keyboard isn't as easy as I was hoping it would be. As awesome as the concept is there needs to be better grips to take the iPad off.Opening the keyboard with the iPad is a pain. As you try and open it the iPad practically slips over the keys and flings out. The iPad swings a little too freely and doesn't exactly support the weight of it too well.All in all the airbender keyboard is awesome and is worth the money.

My phone does a much better job.  Currently, my wife and I both have Nuvi 1450s, with lifetime maps and traffic.Garmin routing has always been ""quirky,"" and it has never improved.  I take an interstate into work, and the Garmin 1450 insists on routing me off and back on the interstate several times on the way (yes, I've checked and rechecked avoidances, routing methods, etc.).  Unfortunately, it behaves this way with disappointing frequency in other areas (my wife's unit behaves the same way). None of the turn-by-turn apps I've tested on my phone make this kind of error.  I can't imagine why everyone but Garmin can figure this out. I simply don't trust the Garmin in unfamiliar areas.I bought the 1450LMT so I could monitor traffic during my daily hour-long commute, but I've found that both of the traffic apps on my phone give me much better traffic info than does the Garmin.I had been using saved routes to work around the poor navigation on the 1450, but the latest firmware update has made the routes function much more bothersome to use.I still gave the 1450s 3 stars, because the display is good (easier to read than a smartphone!), although I should note that my wife's 1450 developed a circular dead spot about 3/8 inch in diameter after only a year.  The voice directions are clear and generally timely.

Since they weren't going to do it this time, I knew it was time to upgrade. I got a 32gb HD with no hesitation, there are a couple of things that you need to know about if you really want this compared to the Apple Ipod Touch.What I think is the best part about the Zune HD is its beautiful OLED screen. You don't know how beautiful a video or picture can look on a small device until you look at it on the Zune HD. The black quality on the screen is amazing and the colors are so vivid. Some of the features on the device is really helped out by the beautiful screen that this device possesses.Graphics: With a stripped down version of the nVidia Tegra chip inside the device, you can not go wrong. It has 8 processors making the device working at its best. It will definitely help once 3D games come to the device. Can't wait for that to happen!!!Software and Marketplace: The Zune software is...nice, could be better, could be worse. I like that it is customizable unlike Itunes. The marketplace is pretty, it could definitely have more videos and movies, but lets not forget that they just started with movies when the Zune HD came out. Still, many of the TV shows that I have like watching on CBS and FOX are NOT on the Zune Marketplace, which disappoints me. This can be apart of the review because this is the only software that the Zune is compatible with. Yes, its only on PC, its so sad that people with Macs can't use it, that 5-10% that can just use boot camp to use it. I mean seriously Mac users, get over it, YOU CAN USE IT!!! I have always like the wireless sync feature just in case I just don't want to find my sync cord you can just bring up the software and on the device just click wireless sync. Podcasts are handled on the Zune software. The catalog of podcasts are not as big on Itunes, but that is not such a big deal. What is great about it is that you can choose how many that you want to keep on your computer, so it automatically deletes on the ones that get old or outdated. You can also choose which ones to automatically sync to the device. Whether it be all of them, or just the ones that haven't been played yet and the ones that get played on the device get deleted after you watch.Apps: No store here. People who want a device for apps, its not here. The Zune HD has a very few simple games and only 2 applications. Microsoft has promised that they will be adding more to the catalog eventually, but its not here. The games and apps that they already for the device are nice to have. I always the Texas Hold 'Em game, simple but nice. The newest update allows 3D gaming which is great. Audiosurf Tilt is simply amazing with the screen. They are all free, thats a plus, but the catch is there are short advertisements before the games come up. Thats not such a big deal if you can get all of their stuff for free. I would much rather, though, pay for a valuable app from other developers. Microsoft has to keep with the times and allow other developers to create their own apps. Once Microsoft actually reads something from their reviewers and listens to them, they might get somewhere even further.UI: Beautiful, Microsoft was really working to create an interface for a touch device. They did a beautiful job at doing so. The searching for media on the device is so easy and very quick to learn. I absolutely LOVE the sidebar on the main screen. You just click on the left side of the main screen and this other screen comes up with ""Pins"", which are basically songs, pics, or videos that you like you can pin to the side bar so you can quickly access that when you turn it on. The next feature on that screen is history, which shows everything that you have been doing on the device like songs that you just recently listened to, podcasts, or websites that you view on the web browser. The last feature on that screen is ""New"" which shows the newest things that you recently added to the device so if you just added a song to the device, just go to the history screen and you can easily play the song without going through any menus. You can also delete ANYTHING that you want off your device by just clicking on the item. I know that the Ipod Touch does this, just not with everything.Music and features: Sound playback has always been the best on the Zune. They decided to bring the basic EQ back to the device, which is nice...just not nice enough. A customizable EQ would be great. You don't even need an EQ if you have the Zune premium headphones, with both of them together, it sounds amazing, Bose headphones, get out of the way (seriously)! I love the new music menu features on the Zune HD. First off, the artist menu is amazing. It starts off with the artists picture in the background and it has the basic albums and songs side menues, then theres artists pictures, which you can use as your background by the way, it also has a full bio of the artist on another side menu which is awesome, who wouldn't love to get a background of the artist. With the new firmware update now also there is underlined part in the bio which allows you to click on them, which is normally artists or other albums, and you can use the devices wi-fi directly from the bio and go to the artist or other album and download it with the on-device marketplace. Whats also included is related artists, which has a picture list of all the related artists which you can click on to either access their artist menu, or go to the on-device marketplace and download their stuff. What I think is the best is the screensaver mode when you are listening to songs. It really takes advantage of the screen. It starts after around 15 seconds on not touching the screen. The artist picture is in the background and the information from the screen is scrolling around the screen in all different directions, if you have used the Zune software, you might have seen this feature. Its just the icing on the cake. Microsoft really did try to get the music exploration aspect in Zune and they did a very good job.Videos: Simple enough...with the screen all the videos look beautiful. You can either choose since the device is widescreen to either keep the video at its full screen and have black sides or zoom in and make the video full screen. I love that you have the choice to do that. Colors really show up on this device so if you plan to watch an animated tv show like Family Guy, you can actually tell what color the wall in the background is.Zune Pass: Genius...$15 a month for unlimited streaming of songs and you get to keep 10 of those songs each month. So if you compare it to Itunes...10 songs for $1.29, you spend $13 on 10 songs that you get to keep and that means you get unlimited streaming to millions of songs for just $2 a month. What a bargain!!! You also get the the Zune Pass with the On-device marketplace. You can download songs to the device right from the online device marketplace and even when you get offline, you can still continue listening to it. I love the zune pass and its definitely worth it if you love music.On-Device Markeplace - Very nice to have, especially if you have the Zune Pass. They also have the very few apps on the marketplace and you can download updates right from the marketplace, but there hasn't been any updates to the 7 games that Microsoft supplies.Pictures: Beautiful, scrolling to the next picture and rendering the picture from horizontal to landscape takes not time. It uses the same multi-touch feature to zoom and is quite useful. Overall...nice.Radio: This is one of Microsoft's selling points. This radio is FM AND HD radio. Too bad I don't live near any main radio station that include HD radio stations. I don't really see any improvements in the radio either. When I go to the city, I will let you guys know. What I have always loved about the radio is the tag to FM feature, which is when you get a clear enough reception, it will show the title of the radio station and the song that is playing currently. You can tag that song and add it to your cart which you can download with the marketplace. That is a great way to get introduced and familiar with new music.Social: Still evolving...not there yet. I am so sad that they took away the song and podcast sharing from zune to zune wirelessly. Its gone, now there is a way to send songs with an email address or zune tag (or xbox live gamertag) when you plug your zune back into the computer. What they did do is add your zune inbox if your account is synced with your device, and it displays on your device...which is nice. But it is still sad that they took away the wireless song sharing feature. (It still works with the older models if you still have one!)Internet browser: OK...not as good as the Ipod Touch safari browser. There is no flash...yet. But you get the choice to either use the internet browser as a mobile browser or you can view sites in their desktop format, its a choice in the internet settings menu. The keyboard is small, but isn't every PMP keyboard? The added auto-correct features with the new firmware update, but it is still not as good as safari.This was a complete and honest review. I love Zune and I have always thought about going back to Ipod, but Zune keeps coming out with new devices that can not be refused. Music and video playback and exploration...Zune is the one and only way to go. No other device does it as good as Zune. Applications and web browsing are better for the Ipod people. Unlimited streaming of music and keeping 10 songs a month, go Zune. Paying individual songs at $1.29 a month to keep forever, go with Ipod. There are so many things that I listed on here and probably a couple of other things that would affect your decision. But I hope that this helped.5/17 update...1. the newest zune update got rid of all of the advertisements before the apps started2. There are now around 20 apps for the HD including facebook and twitter...still nothing special. Let's just hope the the Windows 7 series phones apps will be compatible.3. CBS and FOX have both been added to the Zune Marketplace4. They have added the Smart DJ feature to the HD device (like Genius on the ipod, but actually gets better results)5. Direct Xvid compatibility...you don't know how much better that made this thing. Makes the Zune way more compatible that now you can directly add .avi files without converting first.6. Internet browser got better, faster tilt sensitivity and faster overall experience. You can take snapshots of what is on the screen while surfing and save it to the device in pictures.",What is the quality of the headphones?,"[""it sounds amazing, Bose headphones, get out of the way (seriously)!

The Roku showed up everywhere - blog posts about ditching cable, forums, and reviews. This encouraged me to take the plunge.I was quickly disappointed - the Roku is not a cable box replacement. Nearly it's entire library and design is only centred around the idea of on-demand content, not live streams. The Remote control included is ONLY Wifi, with no Infrared, so if you want to program your universal remote with it you're all out of luck. Neither me nor my spouse liked this included ""toy"" remote or the interface design.The big problem with it, in my opinion, is that each channel is completely separate. Say you want to watch a movie, or see what is streaming on a twitch channel or talk radio station - you have to go into that specific channel/app then look, and then go back to the home screen and move onto the next channel - rinse and repeat. If you've just got home from work and are tired you just want to relax in front of the TV, and the Roku does not provide that experience - if you have lots and lots of channels it's just not possible. This would be excusable if it was android based using existing apps, but this is a brand new platform, they could have done so much more, yet it offers nothing more than many gaming consoles or android mini-PCs.If the Roku could smartly combine my YouTube subscriptions, Netflix movies, and show me what shows were playing on live streams, all at the same time, it might be onto something. It would be great for independent content creators to make their own live streams that could be installed and immediately show up in a central guide. This limitation makes the technology feel early and I don't want to be an early adopter, especially if it doesn't feel like the device will ever become this.I will give some positives - the interface is very fast, certainly the fastest Youtube and Netflix interfaces I've ever seen on a non-PC. The design is slick and the way the Media Player can read NTFS drives is a good feature not often seen on devices like this.Ultimately I decided to return the Roku to Amazon. There are different devices slowly appearing which will offer better Cable box replacements as time goes on, here are a couple of examples:- ""Mohu Channels"" integrates Android Apps and Over the air TV into a single guide, due to be re-released sometime this year.- Channel Master DVR+ which also receives (and records) Over the air TV and includes Custom Apps in the guide (currently only Vudu but more are promised for this year)",Do you have any computer with mouse?,[],[],[],[],[]

That is not a valid site however. I had to search for the necessary software and found it here:[...]Once you get the Windows driver installed and are able to see the drive in Windows Explorer you will find that you have 2.72 TB that is actually usable on a 3TB drive. You will find video tutorials that show how to protect your files and how to use to drive when working with social media (like Facebook). I found the videos to be of very low quality. I could barely see what it was trying to demonstrate but they were somewhat useful if you choose to use their software.You will also get a free 1 year subscription to store you data on a cloud drive. I'd rather not keep my personal files on a cloud drive since I don't want my personal information stored on a server somewhere that could be accessed by others.Using their dashboard software it will automatically copy every non-system file (theoretically this will be your videos, music, and other files that you don't want to lose). I tried out their software and found that it works pretty well. It was easy to learn and use and this method of maintaining your data will appeal to a lot of people. Personally, I prefer not to use the software that came with this drive and have no desire to use it with social media. For that reason, I chose to simply format the drive after experimenting a bit with their software and now have a completely empty drive. It still says there is 2.72 TB available after formatting.According to the literature regarding USB3 is capable of transferring data at a rate of up to 5GB/second. However, when transferring appx. 500MB from the hard drive on my computer to this drive, I found that I had a transfer rate that varied between 30MB and 40MB/second. So, theoretically, transferring 500MB of data should take less than a second but it took about 10 minutes! I wonder if I'm missing something... My computer does have a USB3 port and I am using the USB3 cable that came with this drive. I don't think the slow speed is because of the main drive that is on my PC. Does anyone have an idea why this transfer speed is so slow; relatively speaking?That said, this drive seems to be reliable (after a weeks usage) and it is very quiet.

It is not terrible at all, but a couple items were real dealbreakers for me:1) Low volume level on DVD and Blu-Ray playbackThis must be something specific to LG. I have an LG DVR (LRM-519) that is a few years old and it has the exact same problem. When I play Blu-Ray discs or regular DVDs, I have to turn the volume on my TV or Sony AV Receiver way, way up just to hear the movie at a normal level. I was watching Baby Mama and had to crank my Receiver up to the max volume just to hear it. It is connected with an optical cable, but I have the same issue with the volume through the TV which is connected using HDMI. I previously had my Xbox 360 connected to my AV Receiver and DVDs sounded amazing. I didn't have to turn up the receiver past 45 to get it really booming. With the LG BD 370, I had to crank it at 70 (max).2) The player uses the same remote IR commands as my LG DVRVery few other people will probably run into this problem, but the BD 370 happens to use the same remote control commands as my existing LG DVR. So, for example, when I turn on the BD 370, the DVR also turns on. When I press the Open/Close button on the remote, the DVD tray on both my DVR and Blu-Ray player open. When I press Menu on the remote, it brings up the menu on my DVR and my blu-ray player. This was just an annoyance at first until I realized that watching netflix or a bluray disc on the BD 370 could actually cause me to stop something from recording on my DVR due to the random command being sent to the DVR as I control the blu-ray player.3) Netflix only shows Instant QueueI admit, this is a very minor gripe, but I really got spoiled by the Netflix experience on my Xbox 360. On the xbox 360, the netflix menu shows not only the movies you have added to your instant queue, but also lets you browse a selection of shows/movies in other categories. I have found that I use that feature a lot. So I was pretty disappointed to see that it isn't replicated on the BD 370. However, the quality of the streaming on the BD 370 was every bit as good as on the Xbox 360. Also, I had zero problems connecting to netflix when I hooked up the player. I just connected the player to my router with an ethernet cable and it had no problem getting on netflix.Pro - The ability to watch Youtube on the BD 370 was cool, especially because it allowed me to log into my Youtube account and access my favorites. However, that was not enough to make me want to keep the player.All in all, if you don't mind the low volume level and you don't have any other LG DVD players or DVRs connected to the same TV as the BD 370, it is a pretty decent unit.",Do you have a big problem?,[],[],[],[],[]

You can hear so many things extra going on in your music than before making it a completely new experience even with a mobile device.

These buds with a very low volume drowns him out very well surprisingly and I sleep great! Definitely a huge bonus when I am away from home for 17 hours a day.Beats headphones are a bloody joke!

I showed them mine and I could see them lie when they said the Beaters were better. I'll enjoy my music thank you and they can continue to have an orgy of stray cats fighting over living territory in their ears.In summary, I'm far from being an audiophile. Very far. From my experience, headphones were always just that: headphones. Now I've realized they can be so much more! From my experiences, these babies pretty much alleviate any complaints of other headphones I have had in the past.

It does about as well as a Droid X.- The photo quality is pretty nice @ 12 MP 4:3, or 8MP 16:9... if you can live with no flash, which is a problem with both bright backlight (fill flash) and low light conditions.... and the focus issues are just as apparent in still mode as they are in video mode.- The user interface is really intuitive... except that there's not much control you can exert on this device.Would I recommend it to friends and family?The answer depends on how much you value the quality of your images and video. If the quality of video/stills is not critical, you could definitely do worse.However, if you're a stickler for image quality, then I'd strongly urge you to consider the Canon Powershot S95 - which is the best combination of still and video that I've encountered.

I confirmed this as I did some videoing during the blizzard.  I bought the Wasabi battery pack with charger and their 1200mAh batteries do out last the stock batteries of 1050mAh.  But it won't  add significant life and you cannot swap the battery out with the GoPro Battery BacPac.  So I recommend buying more batteries and having at least 1 battery BacPac.END OF UPDATEThis is a review of the GoPro Hero3 Black Edition.  I am not going to explain what 1080i/30fps mean or any other specifics.  You should already know that since you are looking at this camera.  This is not the forum for technical explanations of what 4.7 Cin means for example.With that said, when I received the Hero3 the first thing I did was fully charge it.  I then went to preform a firmware update.  This was not needed as my camera came up-to-date.  I am running Windows 7.  I have shot pictures and video with it and it lives up to its expectation.Battery Life:  The battery life is short.  More so with the wifi on and/or LCD attached.  (I also bought the battery bacpac and the LCD Touch Screen).  I believe the problem of battery life to be the battery itself.  I own a Hero2 also.  The Hero2 uses an 1100mAh.  The Hero3 uses a 1050mAh.  It doesn't seem like much but I think the -50mAh is what hurts the Hero3.  I also ordered extra batteries from Wasabi.  I believe that these batteries will help this issue as they are 1200mAh.  These have not arrived.  When they do I will post some test results.  I plan on testing all the batteries alone and in conjunction with the battery bacpac.Freezing up:  I have had both my Hero2 (with the new update) and Hero3 freeze on me.  This only happened 1x each and it was when I was trying to rush through the menus. Since then, I have not had any freezing up issues.The screen:  I see people complaining about the little black and grey screen.  It's fine.  You are not buying this camera for fancy screen.  If you want a fancy screen; buy something different or get the touch screen.  The touch screen does improve moving through the menus immensely.  This camera is small so that it can be used in extreme situations without being cumbersome. It's smaller size and weight reductions is incredible.  I hardly notice it when using the head strap.Why I gave this a 4 star rating .... The camera functions as it was promised.  I am a little disappointed that they went to a lesser battery.  Meaning from a 1100mAh to a 1050mAh.  I am also upset with the fact that for all products I have to print out the manuals.  when spending $400 ... I expect the manuals.  Lastly, no covers.  If you want covers for the camera itself and the housing, you have to purchase them separately.  with those few list inconveniences; it was enough for me to take away 1 star.Few last words: DO NOT BY THIS CAMERA FROM GOPRO ...

Sorry Canon, I really like your products, but KEEP UP WITH THE TIMES for goodness sake!!!! (Excuse the rant) I've tried just about EVERY point and shoot that takes some kind of video, plus countless other digital cameras over the years. The HD P&S;'s I've tried are: Canon TX1, Panasonic TX5, several flash drive camcorders that also take still pic's, Sanyo HD1000 & HD700, Samsung HV24HD, and ALL the Kodak's that take HD Video. Plus there has been other camera's - too many to mention (i.e. Canon 550, 770, etc.)Anyway, I just bought (and returned) the SX10. I really wanted to love this camera, but will stick with my Sony T500 for now (check my review of the T500 - that little baby is a keeper).To keep it short, the still pictures are what you would expect from a Canon, but actually, I think my old Canon G7 takes better pictures. But here are the grips (I prefer the cons in a review more than the pros) in no particular order.1) The Camera is BIG. Easy to hold but BIG. Love the flip screen - but the camera is BIG. Great lens - but BIG. I guess what I'm trying to say, the damn thing is BIG, almost as big as a DSLR. This is something that you can not just slip in your pocket and run! I guess I would put up with the BIGness of the camera if the video was better (see below).2) Battery: some might like it, but I did not. Four ""AA"" batteries! I had to buy a rather expensive charger and rechargeable batteries. Come on, what's going on here! Now adays with all this new technology, Canon couldn't come up with a small battery that holds a decent charge! I know the Sony T500 has poor battery life, but at least the camera is small - you would expect that! Who wants to schlep around 4 extra ""AA"" batteries - not me! This one was my fault, I did not ever read about the batteries before I bought the camera, but like above, if the Video was better, I could look the other way.3) Video: This was pretty important to me (again check out the T500). What is up with only the small video format when EVERY other camera company is opting for new 16:9 widescreen format? Again, my old G7 takes just as good ""small"" video and I can play/edit it with anything! Actually, the video from the SX10 is not all that good, except the fact that you can zoom all the way in (actually that is pretty cool), but not worth keeping it. I was hoping that even though the SX10 was not widescreen 720/1080, it would take decent ""HD like"" video with the new .MOV video format. Why Canon did not bring the SX1 out first I'll never know; because then if the videos were good - I might have kept the Canon. As many other reviewers have mentioned, I just don't understand these companies or their marketing plan. If they need any help, all they have to do is ask a few geeks like me - I'll tell em' an ear full!So all in all, I'm keeping the Sony T500 - even if the pictures are not quite as sharp.

The default auto-focus doesn't work to great in the dark, but the quick auto-focus is nice since it shows you green boxes where it's focused.  It's nice that you can zoom in using the LCD screen so that you can ensure your focus is good, but unfortunately, this doesn't work while in video mode.There's not fully-automatic auto-focus in video mode, but usually the cameras that do are too noisy.  You can change the settings so that half-way pressing the shutter button makes it refocus, but it does the slower method and changes the exposure while it focuses.The battery lasts plenty long when doing photos, but video...not so much.  If you plan on doing a video shoot of any length, you'll need to purchase additional batteries.  I'd recommend getting a battery/power grip.  They have a cheap one on here that comes with 4 batteries and has a timer for doing delayed photos and time lapses that I'd recommend.Also, for fun, install the Canon EOS Utility on a laptop.  You can use your laptop to take pictures, do time-lapses, change settings on the camera, and more.Technicolor has a picture profile you can download called CineStyle, which is good for color grading your video in post.

The hardware is fine, but as many here have indicated, the product is only fully realized with good software maps, which are purchased separately (from Garmin). Now I have not had good luck with my handheld GPS's: one stopped working, I lost 2 of them, and a fourth got run over by a car in New Zealand. Of course no one would expect a replacement for a lost device, so I bought new ones FROM GARMIN. But I then had also lost use of the maps that I purchased, and Garmin will not authorize you to use a map you previously purchased on a new device. As was told to me by a (friendly) phone rep, Garmin makes most of its money on software.Now there are people who will cheat by perhaps selling or giving away a device with software and then ask for free replacements. So it's understandable that Garmin guards against that. But they are totally rigid about this policy, and my experience shows that it's greed rather than a concern about cheaters that is involved. When my expensive Garmin unit got run over and damaged, I offered to send the damaged unit back as proof that no one else was using the software, and they still insisted that I had to buy new software for the new GARMIN GPS I had just bought as a replacement.I think a customer-friendly company (like Amazon) would make some good-faith exceptions, especially with a customer who had bought so many of its products (and repeated software purchases). You should know before buying a Garmin product that Garmin is not that kind of company. The latest map involved is one that is 5 years old, not all that valuable, but still Garmin would not replace it. And the one that is on this device (the one that comes free with the Venture HC) is, as other reviewers note, not very good, so if you buy this product, you will probably also want to buy some good maps to go with it. Just know what the Garmin policy is about this and what kind of company mentality is involved. Don't think, for instance, that if you pay for the maps and then just decide to upgrade to a better device and want to send in the old one to Garmin to show you aren't using the maps on two device that you will not have to pay again for the software. You will have to pay, whatever the reason that you are not using it on the original device--because that's how Garmin makes more money.",What port do you prefer?,[],[],[],[],[]

I have a Canon T3i and when I shoot video sometimes (well, probably more than half of the time) it will stop recording either within seconds of hitting record or a couple minutes later. I did a search online and what it seems to be is when you go back through your card and delete certain photos or videos that aren't at the end of the sequence it leaves gaps in the memory, then when you record a video it tries to fill those gaps before continuing at the end of the memory card. Basically, I have to save everything to my computer and format my memory card while it's in my camera before doing any video shoots to make sure this doesn't happen. It seems to work fine if I do that. In theory, if you don't delete anything that's not at the end of the number sequence, it should work fine as long as you have room, but I don't always look at each picture and decide whether or not to delete it before taking another. I have read that this isn't an issue with some other brands like San Disk, but haven't tried for myself.

It also will split connection between various devices, one for phone audio, another for media audio.  I have other bluetooth devices which will accept both inputs from multiple sources simultaneously.

First, I wanted to be able to stream movies and show that I have stored locally on my network.  In addition,I wanted to be able to view HBO GO and Netflix movies on a bedroom TV.  I selected the XS model because I wanted the wired connection.  This thing is great.  It took less than 2 minutes to set it up and go to the channel store.  5 minutes later I had Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, HBO, and Plex installed along with a few more that I had never heard of but caught my interest.  Each one of these was easy to set up.  Plex is the one that allows me to stream locally stored movies and tv shows from a network server.  I have Plex set up on a computer in my home office.  It goes out onto the web and locates movie posters for shows and movies.  The ROKU Plex app displays the movies and shows using these posters.  The interface is solid and smooth and everything has worked flawlessly so far.  My bedroom TV is an older plasma with no HDMI inputs.  I had no trouble using a cable with HDMI on one end and DVI on the other for video that fits my TV.  The ROKU also has a video/audio output that uses an included cable to output an old fashioned SD yellow video, with red and white stereo audio outs.  I used the audio outputs from this jack along with the HDMI to DVI video for 720 video (the best that TV has).  I was worried that plugging in one of the cables would disable the other, but there was no issue.

At first I thought the smaller flatter keys would make my typing a lot less accurate because its harder to feel out individual keys but I actually type a lot better on this keyboard! The F and J keys have raised bumps on them to help you find where you need to put your pointer fingers.  I love the full-sized backspace key (my old keyboard had a tiny one) but I wish it also had a raised bump on it to find it easier. The capslock key has a tiny green light to indicate it is active but the scroll and numlock keys do not have indicators.On the top of the keyboard are media keys - to adjust the volume on the right side, and play/forward/backward on the left side. The F keys double as hotkeys via the FN key next to the right-side alt. There are keys to open your browser, media player, and even restart your pc! On the right side there are even more useful keys! keys for going forward and backward in your browser, opening your bookmarks menu, and opening the calculator. the calculator key is really handy for me as I do my math homework online, and i love that it is right above the number pad!The keyboard is pretty big and has a ledge on the bottom to rest your wrists on I guess. My keyboard tray is a bit small so I would prefer if the keyboard did not have this ledge! I keep my keyboard at an angle and it is just inconvenient. This is really my only complaint about the keyboard! Everything else is great.OH! one last thing to mention about the keyboard is that the keys are nestled tightly on the board so its a lot harder to get crumbs stuck in there! That's a definite plus for me because I have major night eating habits..The Mouse:the mouse is not tiny but also not huge. It is very basic, two buttons and a scroll wheel. It fits very comfortably in my small hands. I've used it both right handed and left handed and its very ergonomic! It only runs well if you have it on a mousepad, which is my only complaint because with other mouses I've used they have worked fine without a mousepad on my keyboard tray. But on the mousepad it runs very smoothly and comfortably.Overall I think this is a great combo! I bought it at Fry's and there was a rebate, so I think I paid $30? for it. I normally do not buy expensive keyboards because I tend to break them a lot..But this combo is definitely worth it. Its of great quality and very sturdy.

It is covered in nail polish and many parts are melted from spilling acetone on it. The paint on many keys has rubbed off from greasy and acetone covered fingers. The media button for going to the previous song got something sticky trapped around it so it is pretty much unusable. I have thrown this keyboard on the floor and across the room probably a thousand times. It falls off my keyboard tray onto my chair or the floor just about every time i get up.

Being an early adopter (I own one of the first 2000 units sold in the US), and owning three Roku players in total, I can say that I am a heavy user and a true believer.  I love the freedom of choice in content the Roku player gives you, with over 100 channels to chose from, including the ubiquitous Netflix streaming catalog, access to Amazon's vast catalog of movies, Crackle, Epic, Break!, Pandora and many, many more.  Some channels are subscription based, while others are free.  However, the abilities of the newest generation of Roku players, the Roku 2, also support 3D graphics and gaming, presented in the form of the now-familiar, downloadable ""app"".  From simple games like Reversi and Mahjongg, to Chess and Angry Birds, the Roku 2 is poised to compete with the likes of the Wii, though that time may still be some distance in the future.  However, right now Angry Birds can be yours for free when you purchase a new Roku 2 player.  Who doesn't like Angry Birds, right?Compared to the original Roku player (now the HD model) and the 2nd gen XDS model, the newest hi-end Roku player, the Roku 2 XS, takes its place at the top of the line-up with authority.  The XS unit does everything the other Roku 2 players can do, plus it comes with USB and Ethernet ports, which the two lower end models don't have, though all models of Roku player are wireless capable.  In addition, with the XS model, you receive a motion control remote (think Wii), which can double as a game-pad when you turn it sideways.  To go with this fancy new remote, you also get a free copy of Angry Birds!  The remote control alone MSRPs for $30.00 if you buy one separately, making its addition to the XS package a real value, in my opinion.  Free Angry Birds is just icing on the cake.With a MicroSD card you can expand the storage capabilities of the Roku 2, allowing you to install more games, and presumably, other content in the future.  Best of all, this is a standard feature on all Roku 2 players.  I did have a little trouble inserting my 2GB MicroSD card the first time.  I figured out that you have to push the card into the slot a lot further than I was expecting, requiring a good finger nail to get it in far enough to click into place.  Once I got that figure out, no further problems using the SD card slot have become apparent.  You will be prompted upon boot-up to format a new SD card, which is the only way to tell you have a memory card installed, as far as I can tell.  After seeing the prompt to format the MicroSD card and confirmation of a successful format, you never see anything else about the MicroSD card ever again.  I assume mine is still working, but I have no way to tell.  It would be nice to see something in the settings menu regarding the external SD card, maybe showing used/free space and mounted/un-mounted status.The 2GB MicroSD card I am using (Kingston brand) was purchased with the Roku 2 XS and an HDMI cable directly from Roku.  I believe the Roku 2 will support larger than 2GB SD cards, but there is nothing in the documentation about it.  I am trying to get verification of this before I try a larger MicroSD card.As for performance, I couldn't be happier.  Content loads quickly and runs seamlessly.  I have a 6Mbps DSL line and have little trouble streaming from two Roku players at the same time, both using my wireless router for access to the Internet.  The Roku players take a little while to boot up, however, they pretty much stay on all the time, so this point isn't terribly significant.  On the other hand, none of the various Roku player models have an on-off switch, which I personally don't like.  I want to turn my electronics off when not in use.  I'd really like to see Roku add a power switch to their players.  I have my XDS player plugged into the back of my surround receiver, which in this case is a switched plug.  When I turn the receiver on or off, the Roku player also gets turned on or off.  The other players are plugged into regular outlets, so I actually have to unplug those to turn them off, which can be rather inconvenient where power outlets are not readily accessible.You can use multiple Roku players in your home without interference from each other.  Do be aware, however, that any Roku remote will work with any Roku 2 player.  This has positive and negative aspects, though I'd say mostly positive.  For the most part, there is little reason to have more than one remote at this time, but I fully expect games developed in the future to support multiplayer, making additional remotes a must for those interested in gaming on the Roku 2.  You have to pair the new remote with the XS, and I had trouble with this at first, but I think it's because there was another standard Roku remote in the room during setup.  After removing the batteries from the older remote and rebooting the Roku 2 XS, I was able to make a successful pairing using the manual pairing option from the settings menu.  The new remote works well for standard Roku menu controls, but it really shines when you try it out with Angry Birds.  It is a little twitchy at first, but you quickly get used to the sensitivity.  It would be nice to see an addition to the settings menu for adjusting the sensitivity of the motion controller, but it isn't too bad at its default setting.  With a little practice, you'll be flinging those birds exactly where you want them!Overall, the Roku players have been a great addition to my entertainment options at home.  There is room for improvement, but I believe Roku has the best product offerings even so.  From the first Roku player with nothing but Netflix, to the current generation of Roku players supporting Angry Birds, Roku has made a real winning multimedia product.  Streaming media is only just now coming into full swing, and the Roku players have made much of it possible from the very beginning.  I am the happy owner of three Roku players, and I love them all.  I would heartily recommend them to all of my friends and family, many of whom are already Roku customers.",How is the guy?,[],[],[],[],[]

Anyway, Chromecast works basically as promised. It's sort of neat that I can pull up a youtube video on my phone or tablet or computer and get it playing on my big screen.It was apparent right away though that the image was cropped on my screen. I'm running a 1080p stream to a 1080p screen, and don't have this issue with my PS3, Xbox, Blu Ray player, or Boxee or Roku. I streamed my screen as well, and sure enough it wasn't a true representation of my laptop screen. Didn't matter what I streamed from either - I tried doing so from my phone, and the youtube video was cropped on all sides - looked zoomed in. I played around with my tv settings, and it didn't fix the issue. There's no settings to be found for fixing it either.Even zoomed in, it was a nice quick way to send youtube to my tv (even though I have other methods) - it's easily the fastest way considering the time it takes to fire up other devices. Hulu was also zoomed in, and the performance was choppy. I noticed I had to have the video playing in my laptop at the same time and I couldn't close the lid on my laptop. If I went full screen, Hulu would show full screen on my tv, but I couldn't do anything else with my laptop. The video on my laptop was not synced with the video on the screen. So if I want to watch hulu and do other stuff with my laptop, I have to watch it in the browser window which you can see on the tv screen rather than full screen. Full screen crops the video anyway though like I said, so there's really no good way to watch hulu I don't think. Unless I'm missing something.Netflix had the same issue as Hulu with the cropping and full screen. Youtube didn't have the full screen issue where I couldn't do anything else with my laptop... just the cropping.This is a decent little device for the price, but I probably won't use it for much besides youtube streaming. I'd say for what it costs, if you plan to only use it to stream Youtube, it's worth the money. Otherwise, save your hdmi port for something better. If I had a time machine, I would probably not buy it again since I don't really need it. In fact, I may relegate it to the bedroom tv that never really gets used.

That being said the Roku 3 is the fifth Roku I have personally installed. It is amazing that its ease of setup continues to get ever better. Take it out of the box, peel off the protective plastic, hook up the HDMI cable to your TV or monitor and the back of the Roku 3, connect the power brick and a Ethernet cable and you're done. That's it, you can't complain about 3 cables now can you?Unlike many other products, the Roku has no power button, it consumes so little power it really doesn't need one. This means when you are ready to watch a show, there is no waiting. I knew from previous models (Roku 2) to put batteries (included) in the remote prior to going through setup. This ensures the Roku finds the remote and synchs up with it right away. Speaking of the remote, the new Roku 3 remote has an earphone jack built right into it's side. What a great feature, now when sitting in bed you can easily add earphones so as to watch TV without ever bothering the other half. The volume control is handled by two buttons on the opposite side of the remote, just where they should be. It is features like this that demonstrate the folks at Roku actually use their own products and pay close attention to detail. Small things like this really make the experience much more pleasurable.Once you have powered on, the mostly automatic setup is a breeze and super easy to deal with. Just for the sake of seeing how well it worked, I connected the Roku 3 through both a Ethernet cable and over wireless to my dual Netgear wireless router. Added the Mac: address to the router and had it reserve an IP. Ran the wireless detection and it configured first time through without a hitch. Then I switched the cable for the faster speed over the gigabit network. I can always fall back on the wireless in case something goes bonkers with the cables.Once the Roku 3 was up and running with my Roku account, it downloaded the new firmware, updated all my channels and I played a game of Angry Birds Space. Love the new remote, really works well for playing games like Angry Birds. As much as I like Angry Birds, it was time to put the Roku to it's best use, watching movies in HD on my 27&#34; monitor. Went straight to Amazon Prime, linked the new Roku to my account and rented SkyFall in full 1080P. The picture was outstanding, not one hiccup or stutter, and no buffering at all, not once. skyfall is a killer movie by the way, I highly recommend it:)All in all, the Roku 3 is just another prime example of how to do things right. Check out the new interface, search capability, and channel store look and feel, you won't be disappointed. Changing settings has never been easier. With a great new interface which allows you to go right where you need, to change between network types, interface themes, audio modes, time, etc. you'll be watching and playing within minutes of opening the box.This new Roku is a real pleasure to use, never even looked at the literature that came with it and was watching a new release HD movie in under 15 minutes, and two of those were waiting for the popcorn in the microwave.

I would prefer if they were a little better built, but they're acceptable for the price. The fabric used on the ear pieces and the head padding is the same fabric they use in fabric lint rollers. It's soft enough, but collects lint accordingly. The mic boom is flexible rubber and decent quality, but it doesn't allow you to adjust its location in and out and sits further from the mouth than expected.Pros:Sound - The sound quality is very decent. I'm not an audiophile so take it with a grain of salt, but both games and music are quite enjoyable for me with this headset.Comfort - At first I found these uncomfortable and pinching which after an hour of use caused significant discomfort. However, once I lowered the ear pieces to wear this a bit loose (more loose than I normally prefer headphones) they fit much better. After hours of use they are still comfortable for me.Microphone - The mic is very sensitive and picks up sound really well.Cons:USB - The USB interface is one you want to avoid for headsets if you have a good soundcard. USB headsets include their own audio card built-in to the device in order to work. Therefore, using these will bypass the soundcard in your computer.  Also, the USB cable is quite short. This device isn't compatible with USB 3.0. Since I only have 3.0 on the front panel of my computer I would prefer a longer cord to run it from the back.Dolby - The simulated 7.1 is not appealing to me. It simulates surround by making the audio more `spatial'. This doesn't add to the audio quality though; it makes the sound worse in my opinion. The default setting is off,Volume Control - The volume control is a rocker switch in a convenient location on the back of the left ear-piece. The rocker switch is annoying. You rotate and hold it in one direction or the other to change the volume. I would prefer a dial instead of holding a switch.No Audio Controls - This device has no equalizer to adjust the audio. The audio levels it ships with is okay, but if you wanted to customize your sound you should purchase a different headset.Microphone - The mic is overly sensitive and even on low input volumes it picks up any background noise like you mouse and keyboard, breathing, etc.In summary, decent sound and comfort for the price, but has some limitations.",How is the sound quality of these plantronics microphone ?,['The sound quality is very decent'],[525],[5],[0.6333333],[ True]

While the control capabilities is nice (in theory), the sound quality, durability, and actual ability to control playback makes me happy I bought these well below retail price.As far as sound quality, I would place these in the realm of $20-$30 Skullcandy earbuds. They produce absolutely no bass with any music, and podcasts sound extremely tinny. The drivers are so light that I realized out of the box these would not impress. I have used higher priced Klipsch before, and these had none of the full sound previous pairs had. I am currently using Bose IE2 earbuds as well, and moving back and forth from the Bose to these it surprises me how much cleaner the Bose sound.The build quality is also lacking. I would qualify the build as better than cheap Skullcandy earbuds, but I expect these to shred apart in less than 6 months after careful use. The shielding around the wires is thin, and the connection point to the buds feel like they will either loosen too much or the shielding will wear away at the bud contact points. The ""remote"" portion is not as solidly built as can be, but the one control button has a good click to it. Overall a cheap feel.The actual fit is not bad at all. There are multiple tips, so one is bound to fit properly, and they do a decent job of isolating sound from a tight seal in the ear.The actual control of an Android phone (Droid Incredible 2) is spotty. The app to fully utilize these has a decent amount of setup options for only having one button to use. Sometimes the earbuds control spot on, sometimes I accidentally hang up on a phone call by mistake. There seems to be noticeable lag or non-responsiveness with button presses at times, and was verified to work the in the same spotty nature on a Galaxy Nexus as well. I would have loved a separate set of volume up/down buttons, instead of having to long hold the button to go from lowest volume to loudest without any accuracy. On a positive note, basic interface works on iPods/iPhones as well, with the ability to play/pause as well as start up voice control.Call quality is pretty impressive overall. People on the other end sound fine through the headset, although a bit hollow and distant sounding. I have been told after multiple calls that the quality of my voice through the microphone sounds good, even with me leaving the mic portion hang naturally from the cord without me holding it. The only negative about the mic is that is seems prone to pic up ambient noise as well as wind, but in a quieter indoor environment there were no issues.With a limited supply of controllable earbuds for Android, these may fit your need. They do work, but do not expect anything more than a passable experience and barely passable sound quality. The $99.99 asking price is outrageous.

It has a screen protector and is very thick. It gives you a sense of security when standing with your device. The leather strap is a nice touch and it fits so nice once you adjust it. This makes it so much easier to hold your ipad. This would be perfect for someone who has to walk around while doing stuff on the job. Perfect when you're trying to look at plans or lists while carrying out tasks. It's near impossible to drop this thing. You can also rotate the strap so you don't have to twist your wrist off to view it in a different orientation. The one thing though I had so much trouble opening the kickstand due to the fact that I didn't realize the angle I had to pull to open it. Also the case is rather unattractive if you don't account the leather strap. It just seems weird to have a nice strap and then have an ugly exterior. I give this a 4 out of 5. Durable and secure.

For me, the pros did not outweigh the cons with this one.It easily doubles the weight of the iPad (generations 2 and 3 are sized and weigh the same), making it cumbersome to handle and carry. I can see why people and their kids are dropping it with this thing on, and the solid heavy weight and bulk it created made it more prone to being knocked around in my bag. In fact, it barely fit into my bag with this thing on. I mean, it's thicker than my MacBook! This is because the shield (that doubles as a stand) juts out about half an inch to keep the stand inside from resting against your screen when you have it on to travel.  In terms of weight and size, I would say it's the difference between lugging around a heavy hardback book (and trying to stuff that in my bag) instead of having just a slim trade size paperback (as with a folio case).The other thing I disliked about the shield/stand thing was that I found it difficult and noisy to remove and set up.  You've got to pry the shield off corner by corner by either bracing the iPad against something or pulling the shield in one direction and pushing the iPad in another.  I was having to do it all the time, (which just made it more likely that I'd drop it) and there was also always this obnoxious creaking/clicking sound as i did it.  That sort of thing bothers me because---okay this will probably piss off some of the over zealous reviewers but, I wouldnt want to draw any more attention than the case already does on it's own, as it is embarrassingly overprotective and makes your iPad seem like some mysterious giant tablet or you know, like some kind of fisher price tablet... .i mean, i know some reviewers are saying that people often admire their otter cases and ask about them...but I think it's more like they're admiring your giant Fire and thinking wow, the Fire really IS like the iPad!  Maybe I should get one...  Maybe it loosens up after a while, but the design is so solid that this seems unlikely. It won't bother you if you only use the shield as a stand or to travel, but the screen protector is just a clear sheet of plastic like any other screen protector so I guess I just prefer to have the sort of cover that I can just close over the iPad like a book cover when i carry it around casually.All that aside, the case is still nice and the fit is PERFECT, but I think it's overkill unless you actually need this sort of protection---like if you have little kids that will be using it, or you use it in a job where it'll be abused on a daily basis--otherwise there are plenty of cases out there that fit just as nice but are more convenient (not to mention better looking).  This also isn't the sort of case you will want to be taking on and off; it's difficult to remove so you can't just switch to this one for work/travel and use a more comfortable one for at home.",How is case?,['This is a nice case' 'This is a nice case'],[0 0],[1 1],[1. 1.],[ True  True]

Does it give the best protection like an expensive otterbox that has a rubber layer, plastic layer and screen protector? No but the amazon kindle fire hd case is the thinnest, lightest and coolest looking case and also like $25 less. Sure I am sacrificing some protection for style and size. I can fit my kindle fire hd with the case inside my inner jacket pocket while I know that I can't do that with the rest of these larger cases. Does it have the best stand? No. I would think that a stand that clicks into place would be better but this case does have rubber grips and it has never failed me. Some people may want to use the stand and push on the screen with their finger or stylus and it could be an issue there but I even use my stylus with the stand and it held up. Where this case compensates and has the edge over the other cases is.... 1. It snaps in and fits so well that the kindle fire hd and case appear be one piece together. It makes it so light and thin. 2. The case wakes up or puts to sleep the kindle. 3. Magnetic cover keeps it close and I think it is strong enough. 4. The pebble look leather looks real nice and fancy and inside the case there is a ""denim looking"" cloth that protects the screen. 5. The speaker is covered and protected with designed openings. There isn't a simple cutout or it isn't covered over to muffle the sounds. 6. The inputs like the power button, volume, charging port and headphone jack all work very well for me. I know some people complained about the headphone jack being too small but it fit fine for my ipod headphone and even my larger headphone that has larger size hexagon input. 7. While it may not be the best protection, it still gives you very good protection. I take good care of all my electronics and was more concerned with scratches/scuffs on the screen rather than impact falls so I think this case will be fine. Even if I dropped it on hardwood floor from 4 feet, I think it will hold up and protect the kindle fire hd.

The TV has to compete with high levels of daytime ambient lighting and reflections. It does so admirably. The panel itself is not of the ""glossy"" type, which lends itself to reducing the reflections that some other displays ( notably plasmas with their glass surface ) have. In a perfect world, the Vizio would have a limited sheen bezel as well, but this is not the case. Piano black and very glossy.Connectability:  A full complement of connections are available and well thought out on this display. If you are going to connect any legacy equipment that requires analog connections you will not have the problem of running out of input jacks. (As a side note, be aware of the lower priced models. Vizio has ""dual purposed"" the component/composit jack pack making that connection an ""either/or"" situation.) A side jack pack is also available and is handy for temporary hookups.Ergonomics:  The remote is a classy little brick. The qwerty keyboard on the flip side proves to be very handy if you search frequently for various programming from your cable/sat provider or Netflix/Vudo or similar. My mother immediately said she would never use the keyboard until she found just how simple it is to use in comparison with the standard ""letter selection"" process normally found as your only option. Well done Vizio. I'd like to see some of the better universal programmable remotes have a qwerty keyboard as well.Side control options are poorly marked as usual, but since very rarely used, quite the norm.The stand has an interesting flaw. When properly connected to the panel itself, the display actually leans back a few degrees from vertical. Since LCD technology still requires us to be pretty much centered in front of the display, I found that I had to modify the stance with the effect of pointing the display to the sight line. Since the Vizio is even a touch fussier than some other makers in this regard, I was surprised at the lack of a swivel/tilt stand on this 3d capable display.Performance:  After making the connections and dialing in the built in wifi for the apps, a pleasantly simply procedure by the way, I immediately noticed the limited viewing angle issue mentioned before. Be aware of this if your seating configuration covers a wide area. Those outside of the somewhat limited ""sweet spot"" will not have the same viewing experience as the front and center crowd. If you are front and center although, a very nice bright image is viewed. The controls are all there if you wish to adjust for various lighting scenarios and as an ISF tech, I was pleased to see a full complement of drives and cuts to dial in the grayscale in the advanced user section. After setting the black and white level controls, I measured the contrast ratio at nearly 600 to one using the checkerboard ANSI pattern. Very decent for a ccfl LCD display. The primary and secondary color points were spot on and after dialing in the grayscale a bit, film DVD/BluRay viewing in a darkened room (evening in this case) proved the display to be quite capable. The 3D capability with the enclosed passive shades was not tested.Conclusion:  A lot of bang for the buck here. It is no wonder the once titans of tv's are scratching their heads. Vizio has a fine display here for a well lighted room with a casual viewer as the target market.d6500k",How is the review?,[],[],[],[],[]

Only two firmware updates since the release and main issues are not addressed. I've upgraded to R7000 which has a lot more support.UPDATE 12/26/2013Recently purchased a few latest AC routers specifically Asus RT-AC68U, Linksys EA6900, Dlink DIR-868L, Netgear R7000 and ended up going back to R6300V2. None offered more range or performance of R6300V2 despite having external antennas. While most of these new high end routers had some additional features, some of them had really unstable firmware, especially RT-AC68U & EA6900.  Netgear R7000 is probably the best of the bunch and I would've kept it if I didn't have R6300V2 already. It doesn't really bring more range or performance either and it barely has any new features especially for average user, but at least Netgear has more interest in keeping it up to date with frequent firmware updates.UPDATE 7/30/2013Bought R6300v2 to see if there is any difference. V2 now comes with dual core processor 800Mhz, 256MB of RAM and USB 3.0, it is also twice as small and comes with smaller power supply. All nice upgrades, but did it translate into better performance? In short, yes. For regular users, they may not notice the difference, but if you have gazillion of gadgets that use WiFi especially HD streaming you will be pleased that it offers better performance. I don't have any hard numbers to back this up, but overall this upgrade is totally worth it for my busy wifi network.UPDATE 6/27/2013My R6300 is now over a year old and it actually performs better then it did when it was initially released thanks to several firmware updates. I've tried latest AC offerings from Dlink & Asus and they just didn't offer as good range and reliability as R6300. Netgear might release a replacement soon, but for now this is still the best overall AC router despite what reviews say on smallnetbuilder website.UPDATE 1/9/2013I've been using this router for over half a year now and it hasn't skipped the beat. Performance has been top notch and it can handle 15 wireless clients with a few HD IP Cameras. It's been running uninterrupted for the past 3 month. Sure there are other new AC routers that came out since then, which I haven't tested, but this has been a wonderful router so far and I am not looking for another replacement at the moment. Not surprising that the price is exactly what I paid 6 month ago, which means the router is actually holds its value for being one of the best out there.INTROMy past 3 year history of routers include Netgear WDR3700, Cisco E4200 and most recently two Asus RT-N56u using wireless bridge, but I was never impressed with the speed of wireless and 5Ghz band coverage. This was about time for my next upgrade, so I bought 3 routers RT-N66U, Amped Wireless R20000G & Netgear R6300 and I kept the latter and here is why:THE GOOD:- Range/Speed/Performance in 5 Ghz band: Excellent! While not a huge leap forward it does perform much better than any of the previous and competing routers I've tried using this band. This was a major selling point for me. It is actually able to provide excellent download speeds in the opposite corner of the 1500 sq/feet townhome that none of the other routers could handle. Also with Mac Mini 2010 Broadcom wifi, I was able to achieve up to 22 MB/sec download speed from NAS at about 15 feet with latest firmware. Previously with RT-N56 it topped at 10 MB/sec at the same location. That's double the speed! I can't wait to try this out with AC clients!- Range/Speed/Performance in 2.4 Ghz band: The range is excellent. It covers my entire home, but so did my previous router, so it's difficult to judge the improvement here.  However, there is noticeable performance boost. Among several wireless devices using this band I have 4 HD (1080p - 720p) IP cameras and previous Asus router had trouble with handling all of them with good frame rate where with R6300 I am finally able to stream all of them at once. Also, your performance will depend on the client. Previously I was using 2010 HP Envy 14 w/ Intel 6200 which was showing download speed at 4-6 MB/sec, 2012 HP Envy 17 w/ Intel 6300 showing much better results at 6-8 MB/Sec at the same location. While Mac Mini 2010 w/ Broadcom WiFi shows speeds less then 1MB sec. Basically, older clients may have some performance issues.- Setup:  It wasn't complicated all and looks fairly straight forward for non-technical people as well.- Plenty of features for basic and advanced users: Guest network, Wireless bridge etc... all thereI CAN DEAL WITH IT:- Size: This router is about twice the size of any of the previous routers I've owned- Guest Network: Yes, it's available, but it's very basic. I've seen Asus RT-N66U guest network control which lets you specify the time limit or expiration.- Administration panel locks after about a minute of inactivity and you are prompted to enter your username & password again (very annoying when you trying to troubleshoot things!)- Parental features. I don't like the fact that you need to install tool on your pc, there is no web administration on management in the web ui.OTHER THINGS:- First router that I see without WEP setting.- Some of the older clients (specifically HP Envy 14 w/ Intel 6200 card) had connection issues with sleep/restart. I've upgraded my laptop since then and have not had this issue anymore- Mine appears to be defective where the activity lights at the bottom are not lighting up, except Netgear logo. (UPDATE 7/10 I've gotten a new one without this issue)PREVIOUS UPDATES:UPDATE 10/13: This is probably going to be my last update since I really don't have anything else to add other then this has been a wonderful router ever since I upgraded to 1.0.2.36_1.0.28 version. I've been running without reboots for a month now and no problems with performance whatsoever.UPDATE 9/6: 3 month later and still loving this router. If you live in a large home and have wireless coverage issues with 5 Ghz band you should definitely give this one a try. Overall it's been rock stable for me with only one nagging issue related to 5Ghz band (see my previous update). Netgear support got a hold of me and I've been helping them to troubleshoot the issue by sending router logs. They provided a beta update for me that fixed the issue which they will be releasing in September.UPDATE 7/10: Month later the router still performs very well. I am hoping for new firmware soon to improves performance and compatibility with older devices. Still have issues with Envy 14, Mac Mini 2010 and also HTC Sensation phone. They all exhibit different issues. First one takes a long time to connect, second one has very low speed on 2 Ghz band and last one occasionally unable to connect. There was also one hiccup. I was running uninterrupted for 2 weeks straight using latest firmware and 5Gh signal degraded from Excellent to Poor and 4 to 2 bars at the same location. I've rebooted the router and everything went back to normal.UPDATE 6/13: 2 weeks now with the router. Sold my two Asus N56U that I used as a wireless bridge and that were once highly rated at SNB. I honestly do not know why SNB posted terrible results with R6300, they must have defective unit but that's still not the case for me. I am perfectly satisfied with R6300 and it delivers excellent performance/range throughout the house without the need of any bridges or extenders which I once had to use. I do have defective unit where I don't get any activity lights, so I might exchange it at some point. Did I mention, this is an awesome router?UPDATE 6/7: Netgear released new firmware which enables Guest network that caused so much noise and negative reviews in the initial release, the were no other fixes listed, but upon my own checking I noticed they added ""Performance boost"" option in the Advanced > Wireless settings. I performed my usual download test which showed a slight increase in download speed on 5Ghz band, but it's hard to say if it was related to the firmware or not.UPDATE 6/4: SmallNetBuilder released preliminary test results that compare performance R6300 with a few other N routers that show that it doesn't perform as good as expected in some cases. Also mentioned my results in the process when compared to N56U. I only had R6300 for a few days now, but my experience for the most part has been positive even with a rough firmware. Also, I usually base my router purchases by SNB reviews, but in this case I am having different results, so I'll stick with R6300 for now.",Dose this performance fine?,[],[],[],[],[]

Turns out, they're all correct.When I first bought the Image S4's at a local best buy, they sounded ""pretty"" good out of the box, but they also sounded pretty painful in certain frequency ranges -- in the treble most notably. ""S"" and ""ch"" sounds in lyrics would punch my ears in the face and make me wince. Songs had a certain shrilling tinny quality to it, that was definitely not comfortable. Well, I left the S4's on my desk plugged into my Zune HD overnight, playing music at random. About 18 hours later, I can already hear a massive appreciable difference in the sound quality. The treble has softened back to a beautiful balance with the mids, no more shrilling pain from lyrics, and the bass has solidly found its place without trying to overpower the whole track. At lower volumes, the bass, mids, and treble are easily audible and full -- which was not the case before, where the bass would drop out, and the treble would overpower the mids.My opinion on the S4's went from ""If things don't improve, I will return them,"" to ""FOUND A KEEPER HERE."" -- And that's only with about a three-quarters of a day worth of burn-in! Most people recommend at least two to three days worth of burn-in to get the truly wonderful sound these headphones are capable of producing. I'm interested to see just how much they'll get from here in the coming hours.Elsewhere, the S4's fit my ears superbly. The oval tips on the buds fit perfectly into my canals. I don't get any discomfort from the build of pressure as I push them in -- the design seems to allow excess air to escape very well. This also means that then I put them in, I've yet to hear the speaker ""crinkle."" The other nice part about the oval design is that if I pull the muscles around my ear to make my ear stretch upward, the seal on the buds are not lost, which always happened on my old Lenntek Sonix. I would have preferred to have seen a braided cord on these, and the buds made from milled aluminum billets to really add some durability value to these, but they're quality isn't lacking as-is. The cord feels a bit thin, (not weak, just thin,) but at least klipsch added some of the best stress-relief shielding I've seen on a pair of buds. You won't see your cable weaken and drop signal on these for a long, long time -- if ever.I've trusted Klipsch before to impress me with my choice of desktop / entertainment center speakers, so when it was time to get new headphones, I thought I would place trust on them again -- and sure enough I'm not disappointed.",How is the bass?,['the bass has solidly found its place without trying to overpower the whole track'],[844],[1],[0.33333334],[False]

There are some other nice touches - the rubber feet, the fact that you can change from portrait to landscape. Once you remove the iPad from the arm, the hard plastic case stays with it so conceivably you could just travel with that. It's not perfect - I realized carrying it in my bag that it is just a little heavier than I would like. And it would be nice if the hinge had a ratchet action.

I don't have anywhere near 16GB of music, but it's nice to have the option for expandable storage rather than be stuck with however many gigs Apple allows you.

For example, I have an Eric Clapton collection that spans his whole career. The album includes songs from Cream, Blind Faith, Derek and the Dominoes, and songs featuring BB King or J.J. Cale. Each one is labeled as a new artist separate from Eric Clapton, so to listen to their songs I have to go to the artist rather than have the whole album filed under Clapton.

Living in Wisconsin, I am a die-hard Packers fan, and being a nursing student, cable is just too expensive for me. I started researching this antenna out of desperation because the antenna tower setup at my rental house is very outdated, and the cable connecting the antennas that are at the top of the 60ft tower is so thin, it looses an immense amount of signal. Anyway, I live about 36 miles from the Milwaukee towers, and about 50 from the Chicago towers. I already had the Antennacraft HBU33, which is an absolutely PHENOMENAL antenna if you are more then 40 miles from a tower (I have never used it for signals more the 50 miles away, so keep that in mind). This antenna (ANT751R, and make sure the ""R"" is at the end of the model number, as the model with the ""R"" is optimized for digital signal, as opposed to the older model which was more for analog signal) is designed for signals within the 40 mile range. I used my old antenna for Chicago stations, and bought this antenna for the Milwaukee stations. The setup works very well so far. I use both antennas with a signal combiner (a splitter that works both ways) and a RCA TVPRAMP1R for a pre-amp, and the picture so far is awesome. This antenna is so small, it seems like it would be ineffective, but WOW, its works like a champ! I will warn you that it does not pick up the lower VHF stations very well (2-6), so I had to modify it with coathangers to pick up those stations (Fox is channel 6 here, which a majority of Packer games are on). I did have to change the location of the antenna after not getting good reception on fox, even with adjustments with coathangers, to a higher place with fewer obstructions (the original place was clamped to the antenna tower as high as I could reach (which was about 10 ft up with a ladder), and was obstructed by the house next door, so your antenna may not have the low VHF issue, but I am not willing to take off my coathanger modification to find out if it works without it (if it ain't broke, don't fix it) in the new location. It is now on the roof of my porch, which is about 20 feet in the air. I also installed this antenna in the attic of my friend's 1 story house who is about 15 miles form the Milwaukee tower, and he reports perfect reception even without any sort of amp. Keep in mind that he was using a radio shack amplified set-top antenna before with a 15-20db amp built in, and on windy days, the reception would be choppy at best. He checked the reception on the day that the winds from hurricane Sandy were really bad in his area, and reported the signal was completely solid, so there you go. When installing this antenna, I would HIGHLY recommend using quad-shielded type f coax cable, to minimize signal loss. I would recommend purchasing the cable from monoprice, they were the lowest price when I installed my friend's antenna. Also, be careful with amplifiers, they can actually destroy your signal if your signal is already strong, so just keep that in mind. If you are at the very edge of the reception zone for this antenna, and your antenna is in a low place, or in your attic, then you may want to look into a pre-amp, otherwise, don't even bother.So to recap: This is a fantastic antenna that may not pick up the low VHF stations very well. I made a long loop with a coathanger and used hose clamps to attach them to the end of the VHF elements to get better low VHF signal, but that's just a suggestion.

It has been a long time ago since I did my last programming, and nowadays I am doing mostly Excel spreadsheets, Word documents, Powerpoint presentations and Pdf document reading. Why all MS Office an Pdf ? Because 100% of our customers and suppliers use it.I like the iPad because I am truly a gadget fan, and I wanted to study its application to real business.My conclusion is that the software which is available for the iPad is still not mature, even tough the concept derives from the ipod/iphone, which have been around for a while now.From a hardware point of view, the device is quasi-perfect. Performance is great, size is OK (albeit I would prefer 16:9) and technological concepts behind the interface are very good. But again, almost everything is inherited from the ipod touch and the iphone. So from the hardware point of view, it is nothing revolutionary. An USB port would be a real plus.From the software point of view, there is much that needs to be worked out:The Numbers appliction, doesn't save files in Excel format, doesn't let fou open/save spredsheets from ""internet disks"" (WebDav Servers), with the exception of [...], which is really used for sharing documents and doesn't allow editing. So for working with Excel spreadsheets and sharing information for editing on the move with your co-workers, the Numbers application is useless.The Keynote app has exactly the same problem. No saving in Powerpoint format and no way of sharing the files for editing with your co-workers.The Pages app better, since it can save in Word format, but still no access to ""internet disks"".There are other offerings for MS Office compatible Suites, but I have evaluated 2 of them and both have big problems saving the spreadsheets, loosing the format and formulas when doing so. Result: Useless with the spreadsheets I use daily.The Mail Application is good enough, even tough you cannot send multi file attachments, so you will have to send the attachments one by one.The Browser will not render flash content. Until HTML5 becomes a widespread standard, this is also a minus, since flash is sometimes required for my business research.And as the last issue, there is not real printing support. Sure, there are some apps out there, but most of them uses ""tricks"" to print entire documents (like using a master pc for example: not really mobile).The iBooks application works very well if you are capable of converting pdf docs to the iPad format. Now I can read 500 pages technical specs on my couch instead od sitting endless hours sitting in front of my laptop (alltough I could use my laptop on the couch, believe me it is not really confortable).So my perception is that it will take some time until the available software matures enough, so that the device is ready for use in real business.As a home use gadget, it is a very interesting and promising device. But be aware: It is an ipod with a larger screen, which has it's advantages, since it can be used for tasks for which the ipod was not well suited to.As the time goes by, I will do more tests and post my findings",How is device?,['it is a very interesting and promising device'],[2873],[2],[0.575],[ True]

If you want fast access to manual controls, this is not the camera for you. If you like scrutinizing the image pixel by pixel, this is not the camera for you. However, someone who's a non-photographer and wants good-looking photos from a small camera in ""Auto"" mode will almost definitely love it.Likes:--------------1) Image quality is good for a camera in this price range. Yes, there is some mild corner softness at 100% magnification, and there are some chromatic aberrations in high contrast areas, but looking at the whole photo at any reasonable magnification, I'd be hard pressed to criticize the quality. The noise is well controlled, and there is enough fine detail to avoid the dreaded ""water color painting"" effect of some other popular cameras. Auto white balance does a good job under a variety of lighting, exposure is generally spot-on, and low-light images are better than I expected. ISO 1600 is usable for small prints in low light.2) Video quality is very good. It uses a high bitrate compression, which eats memory fast, but I can see details in the video that other cameras simply smudge over. My only complaint is that the 1080p video is recorded at 24fps, and is somewhat choppy in motion. Switching to 720p or lower resolution results in 30fps video, which produces noticeably smoother motion. The stereo sound quality is decent, and the mics are plenty sensitive. When zooming during video recording, there is some motor buzz that's picked up by the mics, but it's only noticeable in a quiet environment.3) I like the 24mm wide angle lens, and prefer that over some 100x mega-zoom. It lends itself well to landscape shots, interior shots, close-ups, and other creative photography scenes.4) The camera is pretty quick to power on, and the controls have good response. It focuses in under 1 second, there is minimal shutter lag, and shot-to-shot times are about 2 seconds.5) The controls are intuitive, well-organized, and the buttons are plenty big for such a small camera. I had most functions figured out in a few minutes without having to resort to the manual. The mode switch provides a convenient thumb rest when holding the camera.6) Construction and build quality seems solid. I bought mine at a local store and made sure to get the version made in Japan. I haven't observed the problems mentioned by other reviews, like shaky video zoom or easily scratched finish. The battery door seems somewhat fragile, though.Dislikes:--------------1) When completely zoomed out, the lens casts a shadow from the flash in the lower right corner.2) Video mode is mostly automatic, you can't even adjust exposure compensation. I have older compact cameras which can do this, it would have been nice to have that feature here.3) The quick-set menu is somewhat slow to operate because it does not present as much information at once as other cameras, for example Panasonic's Q-menu. It's a vertical layout with vertical submenus, whereas a horizontal layout with vertical submenus would have been better.4) There is no wind-cut option for the microphones.I'm not taking points off because these are relatively minor issues, considering the camera is aimed at a novice user. It's not perfect by any means, and it's missing some toys found in other cameras, like a high resolution screen, auto HDR, or auto-stitching panorama. However, if your priority is the end result - the quality of images or video coming out of the camera - this one stands above the competition.

It's as close to perfection as any digital camera has ever come. Sure, there are ""better"" cameras for more money, but they are all twice the size/weight. I would get this camera even if I had an unlimited amount of money to spend. There is simply nothing like it. Lots of ingenius user interface elements, superb feel/handling, superb flash (both internal and external SB-400), outstanding image quality, instant response, superb viewfinder, superb LCD... I could go on. I have nothing bad to say about it, and I'm extremely picky. I thought I was going to wait for a full-frame sensor body, but when this came along, I could not wait to upgrade.The lack of a built-in focusing motor is an ADVANTAGE in my opinion. It's one reason the camera is so small and lightweight, and I believe all future Nikon lenses will have internal focusing anyway. So unless you want to use older, heavier, and slower focusing lenses for some strange reason, you'd be paying for and carrying around something you won't even use.In addition to the superb 18-55mm (i.e. 27-82.5mm) kit lens, I bought the 55-200mm VR II and 50mm F/1.8D lenses, the SB-400 external flash and a remote (3rd party off Ebay). I suspect many, many people will buy this exact set of equipment, since it's really all you'll ever need. No need for an extra battery, unless you ever go many photo-filled days without being able to recharge. Get at least two 1GB 50x (or faster) SD cards, so if one stops working (it does happen), you aren't stuck.The 55-200mm VR (i.e. 82.5-300mm) is a necessity for shooting any action/wildlife. The optical stabilization is truly awesome, and better than sensor-based stabilization (e.g. Pentax K10D, Sony Alpha) since you can see it working right through the viewfinder, making it easier to frame/focus your shot. Although the lens may seem slow (f4-5.6), don't forget that stabilization gives you an extra 2-3 stops, so it's really more like f2-2.8 (without the reduced depth of field, of course). DO NOT consider the slightly cheaper non-VR version, unless the slightly smaller size is an absolute necessity.The 50mm (i.e. 75mm) is a nice walkaround lens when you want to go as light/small as possible. It's super fast (f1.8!), allowing you to take handheld photos at night with no flash! It's also a nice portrait lens, although the 55-200 is better (75mm is a little short).The D40x is a poorer choice for the vast majority of people. The extra resolution means your photos take up more space and are slower to work with. It also has a slower max. flash sync speed (1/200 vs 1/500). If you don't know what this means, trust me, it's important, and one day you'll be really happy you have it. Since the D40's pixels are larger (less pixels in the same size sensor), there is less noise, so having ISO 100 is useless. Do you really need 10MP? Do you print larger than 16x20? Heck, do you print at all? I know I don't. Think it will give you more cropping ability? Think again. Without a super expensive lens ($1k+), the lack of sharpness and magnified distortion of the cropped image won't be as good as the uncropped 6MP of the D40. Save the $200 and use it to get the 55-200 lens, or the 50mm lens and the flash.If you're ready to move to a DSLR, take this camera for a test drive. You will most likely fall in love with it's wonderful handling, and excellent performance, as so many people have. There will be a new generation of cameras coming out this fall, so you may want to wait, although there's really nothing that can be improved upon with this camera.",Is it a good lcd screen?,['superb LCD' 'superb LCD'],[487 487],[1 1],[1. 1.],[ True  True]

I received a different pair as a gift for Christmas and loved how they could be applied to my daily life, but they were an in-ear variety that had poor sound quality and was simply uncomfortable to wear.So, i returned them & began shopping around for a decent mid-range over-ear set when I found these. The reviews were glaringly positive & I see why.Sound Quality--I'm a musician, so I have fairly well trained ears. I certainly didn't expect studio quality sound from a $40ish pair of bluetooth headphones. However, the performance and sonic quality of this item greatly exceeded any of my expectations. They sound fantastic and are perfectly acceptable for any casual listener.Microphone Recording Quality--I use Siri quite a bit on my phone & haven't had any problems related to poorly received voice commands. In voice calls the worst people have said is &#34;You sound a little different, but you sound fine.&#34; Again, perfectly acceptable for my standards.Weight--Very light weight. Zero complaints.The Fit--This is wildly different on an individual basis, so I can only relate my experience. I have a bit of a large head and wear glasses. Naturally the concern for anyone with glasses is feeling like you have a pile of stuff pulling down on your ears. These absolutely DO NOT interfere with my glasses. However, I have rather thin framed specs so it allows for plenty of extra room on my ear. That being said, even with thick emo style frames I think these would continue to work without bothering you. I even wear them with glasses while jogging on the treadmill without problems.Cell Phone Integration-- I absolutely love how well this headset works with my phones. I actually use an iPhone 5, but also have an older Evo 4G on hand. It works extremely well with both phones. It syncs quickly and easily, and the right-earphone has 4 well-disguised buttons for call/accept call, skip forward, skip back, and play/pause. All functions worked perfectly on both android and apple platforms. As a pleasant surprise I tapped the call button on my iphone while it was in a standby state. I was delighted to hear the little Siri sound blip in my ear & mic channel open to accept a voice command.Battery Life-- I've used this headset for roughly a half hour a day for a week & still going strong. It advertises 4-6 hours of use & I am inclined to believe it. It seems perfectly acceptable given the fact that this lightweight set of headphones cannot have a large battery in them weighing them down.Range-- Once again I was blown away by the performance. Last night I let my daughter play on my phone upstairs while I played with these downstairs. When I powered them on I was shocked when they connected to my phone 20 yards away through an entire floor's layer of construction. I can basically leave my phone anywhere in my house and simply keep my headset on. VERY nice for those times when you forget to stuff your phone in your pocket before walking away.Final Impressions-- I think what will make or break the use of this product for someone is simply the question of &#34;Does it fit your head?&#34; Beyond that, there's really nothing more you could possibly ask for given the dollars you'd be spending. I am sure there's a pair out there with slightly better sound or an extra button or two, but for the money you simply can't beat these.",How is the expectation?,[],[],[],[],[]

One was the main router and the other was an access point connected to the first via Ethernet cable. In the past few months, one of them started acting up and I decided this was a good time to upgrade. After reading lots of reviews, this was the router I chose and I bought two of them.The entire experience couldn't have gone smoother. After turning off my old routers, I opened one of these and set it up to be the main router. The order of turning things on in the manual didn't work out for me, so I just unplugged everything and started them in order from the cable: cable modem, router, then computer. Doing that, everything talked fine. I ran the quick setup, then went back to change the settings to the choices I wanted. I upgraded the firmware, set an SSID for each band, turned on WPA-Personal and set keys, played with a few other settings (setting IP and hard-coded DNS servers) and restarted everything again with all of my wired Ethernet devices plugged in. I left choices that I used to make manually, like channels, to auto. It worked perfectly right off the bat.Then I set up the second router as an access point. This router has a particularly nice feature in that you can just tell it that you want it to be an access point, rather than a full router, and it makes all the changes to the settings for you. If that's not enough, when in the access point mode, the WAN port becomes a LAN port so you don't have to waste one of your four wired ports on connecting the two routers together. Very nice! I turned off all the various server functions, gave it an IP, set it up with the same SSIDs and keys, took it upstairs, plugged in the wired peripherals and turned it on. Like the first one, it just worked.It's just been one day, so I can't speak to things like longevity, but the set up was easy and the routers seem really solid. As expected, the 2.4GHz band gives me greater range, but that range is greater than what I used to get with my old Linksys. The 5.0GHz band has about the same range as my old Linksys... perhaps a tad smaller. As it turns out, while I did have some speed problems on the old setup, both bands here give me fast, reliable connections, so I really don't see much effective difference between connecting to the 2.4GHz and 5.0GHz bands in practice. Since I run my streaming video via wired Ethernet, I guess that makes sense. I probably didn't need a dual-band router, in hindsight, but I'm happy with this.Also, the combination of this change, and a new cable modem, have resulted in about a 20% increase in my Internet speed. I can't say which component(s) are responsible, but I'm happy with the result. In the end, I can't imagine anyone asking for more in terms of ease of setup or short-term performance than this router. I recommend it.**UPDATE**January 2 2012I bought these back in August and by mid-December, I started having problems with connectivity to the Internet. Some things would work (like web browsing) and others wouldn't (like checking email). If I left it alone, eventually, it wouldn't pass along any traffic at all. Whenever it happened, a quick unplug and re-plug would solve the problem. I won't go into all the details of the troubleshooting, but it turns out that both units I bought have gone bad. I have shipped one back to ASUS for replacement and am limping along with just the one (and having to restart it all the time). When that one is replaced, then I'll send the second one back. I really like the features on these routers, but I can no longer recommend them. When two out of two have failed, then it's hard to think that it's just one of those things. I have lowered by rating from 5-stars to 3.January 23 2012The stars just keep falling on this for me. I still haven't received the one back that I sent for replacement/repair even though their web site status says it was repaired weeks ago. (They received it Jan 5.) They just won't bother shipping it back to me. In the meantime, the other one finally became unusable, so my investment in two of these relatively expensive routers has ended up for nothing. I just ordered an RMA number for the second one. Since it's not working, I may as well see if they'll actually fix it and return it. We'll see. To ASUS's credit, their tech support people are friendly and helpful and one guy did offer today to see if he can get the repair people to ship mine out. I can't live without Internet access, so I ended up buying a factory refurbished Linksys E2500 for about one-third of the price of these. It's running brilliantly and now I'm not even sure I want these ASUS routers back in service once they're fixed. I'm seriously considering buying a second Linksys and selling these when they come back. I've reduced my rating to 2-stars. What's the point of buying high-end products if they keep failing?February 16, 2012The first router is finally on its way back to me. They promise 10 day service, but by the time I get it back, it will have been 42 days. In the meantime, I bought a second refurbished Linksys E2500, and I am not putting the ASUS ones back in service when they do get back. The Linksys routers work much better, have stronger signals and (most importantly) are working reliably. My Netflix used to pause and stop to re-buffer all the time. I never knew if that was about the routers, the cable modem or the Internet service itself, but that hasn't happened once since putting the new routers in place. Yeah, the last star is falling away. I'm getting better service from routers that cost one-third of what these do, so I'll be selling these when they get back.December 3, 2012I've been using the Linksys routers as described above and had left my two Asus routers, returned from repair, in their boxes. I had intended to sell them, but never got around to it. Recently, I decided to set up a media server and thought that gigabit wired Ethernet would be a good idea (the E2500s are 10/100 routers). Cable Internet doesn't come into the house fast enough for that to matter, but moving HD video around the house might. I figured, since I have these two repaired Asus routers sitting here, I'd go ahead and swap out the Linksys ones for them. The Asus ones do have a lot more features. So I upgraded to the latest firmware (3.0.0.4.260), set them up from scratch and put them to work. The good news is that the new firmware does support IPv6 and it works fine. The bad news is, they only lasted two days before acting up again. After working Saturday night and Sunday, I sat down with my iPad tonight and, despite a 4-bar signal, it wouldn't open a web page reliably. I switched it from the 2.4 GHz to the 5 GHz network, and it worked again for a while, then stopped working again. Then I tried to play a show on Netflix from my Apple TV (wired, not wireless) and for the first time since my last update, the show kept stopping to reload the buffer. I swapped the two Linksys routers back into the network and all problems cleared up instantly. Apparently these work for some people, but even after repair and an update to the latest firmware, I am having no luck. Now I'm reluctant to sell them, since they don't really work, so I guess I'll finally write off this loss and give up on Asus altogether.",Where was the issue?,[],[],[],[],[]

It is one of those, ""Get special offers from SanDisk partners"" RPIA's.g) The SanDisk SecureAccess Quick Start Guide is a PDF located in the SanDiskSecureAccess folder.  If the SanDisk SecureAccess process is something that has never been used, this provided guide would be a must to read - it is short.h) If I recall, correctly, the, unwritten, MAXIMUM, vault size is 4gb which is sufficiently large to hold the contents of one (1) DVD.  If compressed (ZIP'd) files are written to the flash drive, it is often possible to squeeze more than 4gb of uncompressed files into the 4gb vault space; however, this is way to subjective to give any ""reasonable"" percentage since compression depends upon the compression software and the file content being compressed (e.g. video, text, spreadsheet, document, database, etc.).i) Normally, I delete all of these provided tools.  If I change my mind at some future date, I can go to the SanDisk website and download the SecureAccess software. (If there is the curious streak, the older U3 software is also available that is more userfriendly and more out-of-date and does NOT use the ""vault"" concept.  Get both the install and the uninstall software if you think about using it.  BTW, you are, of course on your own though the support folks will sometimes answer questions.)j) If you do use the provided tools, do MAKE SURE the Closing your private vault instructions, on page 8 (English) are followed.  The flash like any plug-and-play device will mostly always be unaffected by just yanking from the USB port; however, the more important the information stored, the greater the chance the once-in-a-million ""oops"" corruption will strike.k) There is a place on the drive to attach a lanyard, or string, to keep loss at a minimum.  I am thinking the cap is a gonner since it does not fit all that securely; however, this comment in no way obviates the intended purpose of the device and how it works.  Just doNOT use peanut butter as a place to stick the drive to keep it from getting lost (you are going to have to figure out the reasoning for this comment).l) Did they work?It was curious that the thumbnail icon for the flash drives was that for the ClubSanDisk and not the SanDisk SecureAccess when it appeared.  It seemed to have a great deal of difficulty in displaying after the longer than expected recognition and driver-installation.  Specificially, the autorun.inf was configured for the ClubSanDisk.I changed my autorun.inf to the following (if you choose to do so, YOU do it at your own ""RISK!""):[autorun]action=SecureAccessopen=RunSanDiskSecureAccess_Win.exeicon=RunSanDiskSecureAccess_Win.exeWhat does this mean if the icon does not show?  Well, you may have to ""guess"" which drive letter is associated with your flash drive - no biggie; but, rather annoying.  For some reason, I got noticably slower access and usage, ""IF"" I had a USB3 device plugged into one of the available USB2 ports at the same time.m) Getting the little drive out of the packaging was an interesting exercise in frustration.  The first one I could extract ""almost"" using the cut line indicated on the packaging.  The second one required a little more effort since the cap was stuck to the packaging which required major surgery to get the clear plastic unstuck from the cap.  The third flash was a little easier to extract from the packaging though the cap did provide a moment!  The fourth drive packaging was cut on the bottom end and this seemed to allow easier extraction of the drive and the cap.  Also, then) Insertion and removal from a powered USB hub; and, the same for other USB ports was reasonably effortless due to the lanyard connector that offered a place to get a grip.o) The flash drive device is not realy designed, in my opinion, for a lot of insertions and removals from a USB port.  I always connect these ""cheap"" devices to a powered-USB port so any damage done by the device's connector only affects the easily replaced hub and does not damage my computer.Close, click ""eject"" ... and ... REMEMBER, it is better to be safe than be the ""did it to yourself"" victim because the ""Safely Remove Hardware"" icon in your tray was not used!  A few words of CAUTION, do make sure the intended drive letter for the Flash Drive is the one chosen to be removed!",Was the review very helpful?,[],[],[],[],[]

I had to have it when it first came out.  I've stopped doing that, but in this case I wish I had bought the first Fire.  From using a friend's I was excited when they finally announced the second gen devices.  The original was simple to use and did most things I wanted it to.  This one is incredibly hard to figure out, even with years of techy experience and is more limited in its use.PROS -Feels solid and well built.Anti-glare screen is nice, and the screen is vibrant.  It's not Retina, but then it didn't cost like one so I'm OK with that.Some have reported it being slow and unresponsive, but I haven't had much of a problem except when in apps I know have problems from them doing the same to my phone.  Videos streamed from Amazon look really good.Book reading is surprisingly good for a backlit screen.  Page turns are quick and although they lack the book like ""charm"" of the Kindle reader page turns it is an acceptable substitute.Screen brightness is good and you can see the screen pretty well outdoors.  I have turned off automatic screen brightness though.  I find the values it chooses too bright in most cases and have mine set slightly less than 50%.CONS -No AC adapter included.  Would that have really been that much of a stretch to include?No flash support.  UPDATE: Well...no official flash support.  Thanks to the comment from TomT below I was able to install both flash and my preferred browser (Dolphin) in a few minutes.  Google Flash 11.1 apk and follow the xda developer links...will walk you right through it.  Now if I can get Google Voice working so I can use sonar I'll be a happy camper.  Have added a star since it was this easy.  That still doesn't negate the fact that it should have been included in the first place with so many sites still using Flash.The charge and HDMI ports are on the long edge rather than the short as is on my other Kindles (and the original Fire I believe).  When you want to do HDMI out to a TV you can only turn it one way if you want to tilt it up which may, depending on the case you buy,  totally defeat the stand in the case.  In the case of the Marware leather rotating case you can't close the case when charging because the ports are to the inside.Volume and On-Off buttons are flush with the case and almost impossible to find by feel.  Since the only visual cue for which way you are holding it is the camera lens this makes it difficult in a darkened room.No GPS.  This isn't a deal breaker, but would have been nice.  I suppose they thought since it needs wireless people wouldn't use it like that, but I could always turn on my phone's Mobile Hotspot to use Google maps IF I had a GPS.The ads.  I own other Kindles and have never felt the need to turn them off.  They were unobtrusive and didn't really affect my use of the device.  I even went for them occasionally.  The ones on the new Kindle are ridiculous.  Everywhere you turn they are in your face just waiting for an errant touch to purchase something you don't mean to and taking up screen space. People who care for children or the elderly should be extra vigilant for unintended purchases.Lack of many apps in the app store that I use daily on my Android phone and would use on the Kindle if they were there.  It's clear Amazon doesn't want to take any chances that you might stream something online that doesn't belong to them.  No TNT app, no USA app, no CW app.  I assume the others that I don't use like HBO and Showtime aren't there either?  No support for PowerDVD Remote and PowerDVD Mobile which would allow me to stream my own personal videos from my network rather than having to either upload them to the cloud or onto the device.  Can't access my Dropbox either.  I use my phone as a remote constantly when streaming from my HTPC to my TV and I was hoping I could use the Kindle that way too.Apps that work perfectly well on my phone throw error after error on the Kindle's ""special"" version. Examples: Words with Friends, no paid version and ads lock up the device.  Tweetcaster constantly throws the 350 connections per hour message and I am not a heavy user.  It throws this one when all I do is check it once in a while and have it set on manual refresh.  I ended up in Twitter Jail the first night I had the Kindle and I didn't tweet a single thing!  Never had this happen on my phone.Every app you download results in a ""purchase"" email from Amazon...even the free ones.  I have an avalanche of them in my inbox just from setting it up.  (Yes, I know this happens for phones as well.  I make the comment to point it out to those that don't know.  Amazon should have a better way worked out to handle this by now and since Kindle is part of their proprietary environment and since Kindle is a part of that this is part of owning one.)The Carousel? I hate it.  Everything goes on it as soon as you load or use it even if you don't want it to.  There may be a way to fine tune this, but if there is I haven't found it yet. I put a few favorite songs on the device for when I'm not near wireless and it showed each individual song on the Carousel. The UI is cluttered and as far as I can see there is no way to alter it to better serve your personal needs.  No way to clear the Carousel either.  You have to remove items one by one.  (If anyone knows how to change this please do let me know.)The main screen is obviously front loaded to get you to buy stuff..with the few things things that get around the spoon feeding of ads and buying stuff all the way to the right like photos and web.UPDATE:  I had not attempted to use the camera.  There is no software included to make use of the camera.  The User guide says you can download Skype and that it MAY work with other apps in the store, but there is no way to use it without downloading something and experimentation to see what apps might work with it.  Why include the camera if they aren't going to give you something to help use it?No alarm clock app included.  Now I know there are apps that will do this, but it's pretty much a basic inclusion on most mobile devices these days.Haven't decided if I will return or wait and hope Amazon offers some software updates that make it more acceptable.  It's a brilliant hardware upgrade hogtied by Amazon's watered-down version of Android and the lack of basic apps like camera/alarm that we have all come to expect.

After EASY set-up, I began using the router in my small insurance agency.  I didn't tell my Office Manager I had changed routers.  I waited for her reaction.  She never even noticed the difference between the TP-Link N600 and our previous Netgear WNDR4500 which, incidentally, was double the price.The wireless performance of the N600 router turned out to be a pleasant surprise. Even though the router is less than half the cost of some of the ""big name"" routers, there is no lacking of performance whatsoever.  You may not like the look of a router with its external antennas, but there is no doubt the router utilizes the design effectively.  The speed is outstanding and the range is exceptional.All in all, TP-Link N600 comes equipped with ALMOST every major function you could want from a router.  It is MISSING a 'Guest Network' feature which allows you to have separate security and access restrictions for guests accessing your network.  Other than that, I believe this router can certainly compete with the ""big names.""Adding to my satisfaction, the TP-Link N600 comes complete with a 2-year limited warranty.The TP-Link N600 is a very impressive dual-band router that performs like the ""big names"" but costs about half the price.  It doesn't have the most attractive interface, but it isn't lacking many features.

I've had bad headphones in the past that had terrible bass or treble, but for me its very well balanced. The only complaint about sound is that if you play any songs that has a lot of treble in it, it may not sound as comfortable in the high ranges. Some people mentioned about a &#34;boomy bass&#34; and I disagree. I think the bass is completely fine (I still need to go hear some hardcore bass drop of a dubstep though). I like bass a lot and I put my iPod with Bass Boost and it still sounds fine without being &#34;boomy&#34; or &#34;vibrating.&#34; I listened with my galaxy s4 and that sounded fine as well.ComfortSome people complained that the headband hurts while others say its comfortable. For me, It was pretty comfortable, but not as comfortable as I thought. At first, it's going to hurt the top of your head for a bit, but after you wear it for a couple of days the uncomfortable-ness goes away. Right now after 1 week, I don't complain about the headband at all. Just like any other over-ears it does get sweaty a bit, so don't wear it for too long unless you have air blowing in your face the whole time :P.BuildThe build is pretty solid, but the plastic on the sides makes it feel slightly cheap, but its not much to complain about. It's well built overall and it's portable which is a plus for me.AccessoriesIt comes with a bag that you can put your headphones in, which is pretty nice and unexpected. Also it comes with a 1/4&#34; screw on. Problem I had with this screw on is that when I took it back out, for whatever reason the 1/8&#34; connector bent in the middle slightly (maybe because I screwed it on too tight or something.) I just bent it back with the 1/4&#34; adapter putting it slightly in and bending it the other way and it was fine.OtherAnother thing I noticed was that the cable end doesn't really fit well into my s4 when it has its case on. I have to shove it in a little bit for it to go all the way in. Because it's also with a metal end(which makes it pretty solid instead of a cheap plastic one) I sometimes have problems connecting it to devices like the ipod and s4. But if you just give it a slight push then it should go all the way in. I wish the 1/8&#34; was a tiny bit longer so that it wouldn't have to be shoved in.Pros:- Great sound quality. For the most part balanced.- It's actually quite comfortable once you get used to it.- It's portable- It has the coiled wire so it doesn't tangle so easily- It comes with a convenient 1/4&#34; cable. I use it for my P-155 Yamaha Digital Piano.- It doesn't squish your ears, but isolates a lot of sound if you have sound running through the headphones.- Solid Metal endingCons:- High range in treble can get screechy (but that's if you go really high)- It is uncomfortable at first to the top of your head.- The wire is a little bit too long.- The metal end sometimes makes it uncomfortable to insert into devices like the iPod or your phone.tl;dr: it's very good product for headphones under $100.",What did the bass became?,['that had terrible bass' 'This is my first review for the Sony MDR'],[187   7],[1 1],[0.75 0.75],[ True  True]

She has a Canon EOS Rebel XS and they explained it wasn't the camera but the lens and suggested the EF 50mmf/1.8II.  She loved it and uses it on most shots.

The player died (wouldn't turn on) and froze (wouldn't turn off). Unfortunately the player has to rebuild the music library each time you reset it and that can take up to 5 minutes.  There've been at least 30 times that the music has stopped playing for no reason, and I have to press ""pause"" then ""play"" to get it to play again.  I drove for about 5 hours today and the battery is almost totally dead (I started out with a full charge).  The player turns itself off instead of sleeping, so every time you pause it and run an errand or take a phone call or whatever, if you don't make it back in time, you have to start it up again (and THAT TAKES FOREVER--FOR! EVER!).  Also it makes the most pathetic creaky cheap-toy plastic noises when you handle it (even without pushing any buttons), because the buttons are made of two pieces of plastic that touch each other.The organization and navigation of this thing suck.  I have a car stereo that plays MP3 CDs, and the navigation is painfully simple:  Press the joystick up or down to flip through folders, and press right or left to choose a song. EASY!  I assumed (like a dodo) that an MP3 player as well-received as the Zen V Plus would work on a similar principle.  I was WRONG.  The Zen V Plus sorts by tags, and you can choose to select by artist, album, or genre, or select all tracks. I put a 6-CD compilation on the Zen V Plus, so there are around 100 different artists from that comp alone; with all of the other albums on the player, there are a couple hundred artists in the artist list.  So, yes, I sometimes have to scroll through a hundred or more artists to find the one I want. Did I mention I got this player to use while I'm DRIVING? Can't scroll and drive.  I guess I could simplify the process by hooking up the Zen to my computer, firing up the MP3 management software and creating a playlist, but the software is a joke.  Regardless, once you have a playlist, you still have to navigate through the menus to pick the playlist, then scroll through everything in that list; you can't even re-sort the list (e.g., by artist or album title) as far as I can tell.  If you make a playlist of all of the songs, you might have to flip through 300 of them to get where you want to be. You also have to update that list each time you add/remove albums from the player.  An alternative would be to make a zillion playlists and scroll through those. I don't want to! I shouldn't have to.  So, long story short, ha ha, to get access to all of your albums, you have to either select every album and scroll through songs individually, by the hundreds, or you have to stop after each album and go into the menu and navigate to the next album or playlist, which you can't do while you're driving.  The player doesn't go from the end of album A to the beginning of album B. It stops at the end of A (you can put it on repeat if you want). And just to make this clear as daylight:  In a playlist, you cannot skip over an entire album with just the push of a button.  You have to skip each song until you get to the next album on the list (20 songs on the album you don't like? Then you'll have to push 20 times to get past it). I just want to be able to listen to my albums continuously, in alphabetical order by band - album title, and skip over an entire album if I don't feel like hearing it. That isn't asking much.The alarm feature on this is nonsense.  The ""alarm"" is a black dialog box on the screen. Great alarm, right?The headphones that came with this player are insulting.  They feel awful and they sound rotten (distortion at volume level 8 [of 25]). I'm to the point that I'm wondering if someone dropped the whole thing in a lake on its way to me.  How could anyone think it's okay to sell something like this?So...any good points?  I guess one good thing about this player is that you don't have to look at the controls to operate them (as long as you don't have to look at the screen, I mean). It's easy to tell which control is which by touch. I can't think of any other good points offhand.  I would say ""The Creative Zen V Plus has never personally tried to kill me"" but I'm not totally sure that's true.If anything in this review is inaccurate, please advise! If I can't return this piece, I'd like to know how to make it less useless and aggravating. I'd consult the user manual but it's essentially useless as well.  Thanks for reading!  Please excuse the negative tone here; I am just really disappointed.  If you get one of these, I hope you have better luck than I've had.

Since she is pregnant with her 5th kid, I recommended this budget lens as an all-purpose affordable lens that gives a lot of bang for the buck. Personally, i shoot with the 50mm 1.4 which I love, but this does the trick, especially on a 1.6x body like the rebel xti. Anyone learning photography is wise to get a prime lens and learn to frame shots by moving around. Some say zoom lenses make people lazy. By moving around you can actually find better angles and shots than if you could just adjust a zoom. Sure, zooms are great, but prime's are both cheaper and better, and make better photographers, especially for someone just starting out with a dslr on a budget. The main difference to the 1.4 is the build quality is better on the 1.4 and the bokeh is smoother, not to mention a lower f-stop means lower light shooting without cranking up the ISO but not by much.

I wanted that User Interface, where I see what I am looking for as soon as I turn on the device. I did not want the  distractions of other games and apps to have the chance to prevent me from reading the books that I bought the tablet for.

I haven't tried loading videos on it to take with me on the Go, But i am sure the quality will be amazing just like Netflix or Prime.Also while watching movies the best thing about the Kindle Fire compared to any other tablet is the speakers. They are simply amazing. You get good quality sound without any distortion. and decent bass too. This is great when you are trying to watch videos and there are dogs barking in the background, or maybe  a car driving by you can still hear what you are watching and not have to deal with crackling or other interference from the speakers.I have shown this tablet to a few of my friends, and so far one has bought it (also loves it) and the other is still on the fence (but leaning toward the Kindle Fire HD)",Is this manual useful?,[],[],[],[],[]

I first scanned for channels with my current antenna attached. I then disconnected my antenna and immediately attached the Winegard FlatWave. I oriented it in the same direction used for my current antenna, which is toward the closest major city (about 30 miles away). I also placed the FlatWave as high as possible in the room. I then re-scanned for channels.Results: My original antenna picked up 31 channels. The Winegard FlatWave picked up 12. The difference is that the Winegard antenna picked up only stations from the direction the antenna was pointed, while my current antenna also picks up stations from 3 nearby cities in other directions.Discussion: My current antenna is a DB4 multi-directional type and much larger than the FlatWave. Considering the size of the FlatWave, it performs very well. Depending on the direction the FlatWave is pointed, you will pick up any nearby stations within your area, but just not at the same time.Conclusion: The Winegard antenna does what it says it will do. It picks up stations within the distance specified (actually a little further) and along the orientation direction. However, my current antenna is multi-directional and picks up stations that are twice as far and in various  directions. It is not surprising that it performs better, but I was very impressed by the FlatWave.",How is the antenna?,"['My original antenna picked up 31 channels'

I've got a cheap bundled no-name mouse on my laptop, and I'm stealing it and throwing this one away.  Even that mouse is better than this one.The biggest problem with this mouse is the tendency to double click when a button has been clicked once.  It started two months after I got the mouse.  At first it was now and then, making me think I'd clicked twice.  Six months later, it's a constant thing, probably about 80% of the time.The tracking is also not great.  With a mouse pad it's bearable, without one it's impossible.  Either way, sometimes small movements just don't happen at all.  I'm never really sure where the pointer will be when I move the mouse.The three year battery life was good for about 6 months.  To me that's not a big deal.

On those, I use a Belkin Snap Shield in conjunction with an Apple Smart Cover to provide protection and allow me to type or watch video using the Smart Cover stand features. I was disappointed to find that Belkin (or DeviceWear) hasn't got a Snap Shield type back for the Mini. However, in looking for those products, this case kept coming up as a decent, well reviewed case that seemed to offer what I was looking for.The case itself is cheaply made, but is light and fits the iPad Mini well. I actually really like the back portion - the cutouts are well placed and that part is good looking.As for the cover: The on/off feature works and even though the cover is stiff and not as nice as a real Smart Cover, I could have lived with that. The cover doesn't lie perfectly flat, but I could live with that. What I can't live with is that this case will not function as a stand. You can fold the cover into a triangle, but there are no magnets to keep the triangle together. Without those, the iPad might remain upright for a 4 or 5 seconds before it collapses. I can't believe that didn't put anything in there to support the triangular cover. In fact, if they would have included another magnet in the back of the case, they could have made a very sturdy and reliable stand that would have made this a great value.Today, I returned this case and  got a ""real"" iPad Mini Smart Cover from Apple and even though it is overpriced, the stand functionality is solid. I feel confident when I roll up the cover to make the triangle, it's not going anywhere. Additionally, the quality of the cover is much nicer and feels much more comfortable folded back behind the iPad. I appreciate these things, but would have been happy with the Poetic case, if they would have only added something to make the stand work. Now, I'm waiting on delivery of a thin TPU case that will hopefully take the place of the SnapShield.",Do you have ports available to do all your required work?,[],[],[],[],[]

It has far exceeded my expectations. Beautiful to look at (I went with the silver) with its retro styling, very comfortable to hold, and and an incredible amount of customization. The IBIS is as good as people say, and the pictures are stunning especially when used with good glass. The kit lenses (14-42, 12-50) are ok, but you won't get the benefit of the great sensor with them. I'm using my OM-D with the Pany 25/1.4, Oly 45/1.8 and Oly 60/2.8 macro and am amazed at my results. And if you are on a budget, definitely take a look at the Sigma 19/2.8 and 30/2.8 being sold together for an unbelievable package price from the famous NY dealers. Both of them have excellent image quality and for 2 bills for the pair of lenses, you can't beat the price for 2 high quality primes. I just ordered the combo package as well though I will likely use the previously mentioned 3 on my OM-D and the 2 Sigmas on my Pen E-PL2 bodies (1 visible and 1 IR).And yes, after getting the OM-D, I realized I didn't want to lug around my heavy arsenal of Nikon bodies (D300, D7000) and lenses any longer. The image quality from the OM-D with the primes listed above far exceeds what I ever got from my Nikon setup so I had no hesitation in selling it all. And with my new setup being so small and light, I find I am much more likely to take it with me. The OM-D and Pany/Oly prime lenses have renewed my interest in photography and I am enjoying every minute.Note: The resolution, noise levels, and dynamic range of the OM-D are very comparable to the newest high end Nikon crop sensor bodies. It still doesn't compare to Nikon Full Frame bodies, obviously the sensor size does limit that, but given the cost of a FF body and FF (FX) lenses, not to mention the weight, I think 90% of photographers would be fine with this set-up.I hope this is helpful.",How better is the image quality of this camera?,[],[],[],[],[]

Their are no channels with this system.  The system is probably the most advanced viewer in the industry right now.  The system literally works as a displayer where you can display videos and items from your mobile device assuming that the application is Chromecast compatible.  This part really takes away from the product since not all apps (and for good reason) are Chromecast compatible.  That being said you can also view all computer related items on Windows or Mac.  As the product specifies it requires chrome to do so.  So the compatibility is really around any system that can load chrome.  You can not use window media player per say to view movies or any third party application.  IT MUST have a chrome plugin that uses chrome to view.  For my purpose, HBOGO, Youtube, Facebook, Netflix, Hulu, Showtime, and online viewing it works amazing.

I looked at the Nikon D90 and D7000; as well as, the Canon T2i. In the end I felt the best value was the Canon 60D. I could go on and on about the camera but most importantly I can say I'm very happy with my decision. This camera is stacked with features and takes fantastic pictures. I honestly don't think you can go wrong with any of the cameras but for me it came down to pixels, pentaprism, autofocus, LCD, and price. I have always been a Canon guy (A1, two Rebels) but this was my first digital and I was open to either company. In the end my view was that Canon is a better value at the lower end and Nikon is a better product at the high end.In terms of my decision to go with the 60D over the T2i I just felt that the extra features were going to get me better pictures and ultimately make me happier in the long term. These cameras are big so while the Rebel is smaller it is still a substantial camera with the lens on it. You have to be committed to carrying around a camera of this size. From a price perspective, the 60D was an additional $200. That gets you a better view finder and better focusing. These two things can make a huge difference between getting the best possible picture.Having used a high end film camera since I was 15 I find the controls to be very intuitive. There is a lot there so it will still take me some time to learn all the features but I'm able to get off and running very quickly. When you look at the reviews most of the issues are overstated. The majority of pictures with this camera will be taken in one of the standard shooting modes. The rest of the settings are nice to have but are hard to fiddle with when you are just concentrating on getting pictures taken of a brithday or a sporting event. There's one rule that seems to stand the test of time - the 80-20 rule. 80% of the people will use 20% of the functionality of this camera. The other 20% may use 80% but it will be less than 20% of the time.Lastly, I wouldn't get too caught up with the lenses either. This is a good all around lens if you can have only one lens. Again, 80% of the people will rarely change a lens. There are better lenses but most of us just won't notice the difference. I do believe that image stabilization is a must. In my mind it is the single biggest benefit to the average user. Sure some lenses focus faster or are better in low light but most of us can just hold down the shutter and use a flash.Get the camera and have some fun. There will be plenty of time to upgrade lenses, flashes, etc. You'll never be able to get back the pictures you miss.",How describe the camera?,"['This camera is stacked with features and takes fantastic pictures'

Going in, I knew it wouldn't be a pure Android ecosystem nor would it have the latest in hardware. I looked at the Google Nexus 7 (Asus) and a Google Nexus 10 as well as the Asus Transformer tablets. The positive aspects of those tablets mainly focus on the Android operating system. Since I'm a fairly heavy consumer of Amazon products and services, the Kindle Fire HD (KFHD) isn't a bad choice.It's easy to navigate, although the Carousel is rather annoying than useful. I prefer Android Ice Cream Sandwich or Jelly Bean as it allows far more flexibility and customization. That said, KFHD 7.2.3 is actually based on Android Ice Cream Sandwich, according to Antutu Benchmarks.The Silk Web Browser works much like any other Android browser, and the Kindle Fire integrates seamlessly with your Amazon Cloud services (books, music, movies, etc...) As a Prime member, I can also watch Prime movies in HD. For some unknown reason, Amazon does not allow Prime movies to be played in HD if using a PC - only devices such as the Roku, PS3, Xbox 360, and Kindle Fire allow playback in HD.The KFHD has a micro-USB and micro-HDMI port, with 3 buttons on the side for volume and power. I have a Belkin Chambray case that I first used, but it made the KFHD look and feel cheap. There are lots of cases on the market that use straps to hold the KFHD in place, and then another elastic strap to keep the cover in place. That just looks and feels cheesy. I opted to buy the Amazon KFHD leather case that uses the magnetic closure system. It is perfect! The magnetic flap is exactly what I was looking for! In addition, the buttons work perfectly through the case.The experience of watching a movie on the 7"" screen isn't that great. I prefer watching movies on a larger TV. I also found that reading a book on the KFHD hurt my eyes almost immediately. The lighter background on a LCD causes more strain than the e-ink/pearl screen on the Kindle Touch/Paperwhite. So essentially the KFHD is really more useful for reading magazines, browsing the web, playing games, and perhaps watching a movie/listening to music on the go.The KFDH 7"" has a dual-core 1.2 GHz processor with only 1GB of RAM. I can detect that it is slower than my Samsung Galaxy S3 (1.5 GHz dual-core with 2GB RAM), as it scores only about 6,500 points in Antutu while my Galaxy S3 is at 11,000 points. The screen on the KFHD is crisp. I am able to read magazines using Zinio. In the full page view, the text can be too small although it is good enough for me to skim to find interesting articles.Speaking of Zinio, the Amazon Appstore is probably the sorriest excuse for a marketplace that I've seen. Google Play has far more updated apps. The same apps in the Amazon Appstore are sometimes outdated by several generations, or they simply aren't in the Appstore. I had to sideload Zinio onto my KFHD.I opted to use a regular USB charger, and it takes awhile to fully charge the battery. However, in standby mode it sips power. Another good aspect with the Amazon Onyx case is that the magnetic closure puts the Kindle to sleep (or rather turns off the screen) when the cover is closed without having to do anything else. The battery life is acceptable - the screen is what uses the most power.Overall: 4/5 stars. I have to admit that it is overpriced for what it is, there are better Android-powered tablets (Nexus 7) at the same price point with more hardware power. The Amazon Appstore is sorely lacking compared to Google Play. The 1.2 GHz processor is fairly slow, and there's only 1 GB RAM. The lack of a SD card slot is also a mistake. If you want to read magazines without ever having to zoom in, the KFHD 8.9"" or a 10"" tablet is the answer, but I felt the 7"" is suitable because it is smaller, lighter, and easier to handle.Bottom line is that if you're interested primarily in Amazon content, the Kindle Fire HD is for you. The 8.9"" is best for reading magazines but the 7"" suits me fine. If you plan to root the KFHD, you're better off just buying an Android Tablet like the Nexus 7.

I have had a Lumix FZ20, a Sony 717 and a Minolta 530.For the money the LX3 is simply amazing, but don't expect to be in the same league as the reflex camera, especially at high ISO. If there are lots of shadows I don't like using my LX3 above ISO 400 (that's a subjective assessment). I get about a 2 EV advantage with my D300.The zoom is not especially powerful, but it's so bright and compact I imagine it would have been difficult to design one that would have been at F/2.8 all the way.The depth of field is of course much greater than my larger cameras because the focal length is so small, so it can be an advantage in many situations, and a disadvantage for taking portraits.It doesn't feel that slow, probably because I expect compact cameras to be slow.The quality of the image stabilizer amazes me: I'm able to take many pictures inside museums and have had better results than with my reflexes when I wasn't using stabilized lens. Pictures at a 15th of a second are tack sharp.There is very little chromatic aberration in the lens.The flash is occasionally over-powerful.The video quality is so much better than what I had before.I take this camera everywhere, which is more than what I can say about my reflex cameras.It looks good.On the negative side the manual is not especially well written, but finally you can figure out a lot by just exploring the menus.All in all I would give it four and a half stars, but given the price and the use I get out of this camera I'll give it 5.",How was the speed of the camera?,[],[],[],[],[]

It had come highly recommended and seemed to be a great complement to my beloved 50mm prime and a perfect replacement for the 18-55mm kit lens that shipped with the XTi.Initial, first-night impressions?  Heavenly.Compared to the other lenses that I've put on the business end of the XTi, the 17-85mm is one heavy dude.  I'd wager that it's at least as heavy as the camera and certainly feels as heavy as the 50mm and the 18-55mm put together.  The lens is serious.  It means business.  It traveled back in time from the future to be here with us today.  It's a touch of the photographic high-tech, made accessible to the amateur.With my right hand on the shutter and my left on the lens' barrel, it didn't feel any less heavy but ""heavy"", in my mind, became ""solid"".  The auto-focus is nice and quiet and is reasonably fast to lock onto the subject.  The focusing ring is also nice and big -- it cries out to be grasped and twisted.  It was a joy to realize that even with the auto-focus turned on, the lens would not complain if I fine-tuned a given shot with some manual adjustments.  (The AF doesn't totally commandeer the focus, that is to say.)  The zoom is also smooth, the barrel moving quickly and easily without over-shooting the desired focal length.Image stabilization is also a big plus.  I have a feeling that once I get the hang of it, it will save quite a few low-light, indoor, and hand-held shots over the lifetime of this lens.  This isn't to be nave and believe it to be a cure-all.  Certainly a few of my early test shots with the IS feature on prove that you can still wind up with a whole mess of blur.  But others worked out pretty well.After having used it for about two weeks or so now, most of these initial impressions have stayed true.  The IS feature is a good one but isn't something upon which to rely to save every shot.  You still need to have good light and the right angle, etc.; but with the right ISO setting, it can save the scene.  The heavy feeling of the lens is something I've gotten used to pretty quickly; after a couple of sessions, you just expect the camera to weight that much -- no worries.  I've also found that the longer focal lengths are great for portraiture -- I find myself using focal lengths in the 70-85mm range pretty often now and I wonder how I ever lived without them before.That said, I'm beginning to wonder a little about the lens' chromatic aberration.  I've had a few shots that don't seem to ""resolve"" the same way during post-processing (in Aperture) as similar shots under similar conditions with the same camera body and a different lens (e.g., the 50mm prime).  This is not to say that I have my mind made up and am squaring the blame on the lens -- certainly not!  But I am trying to parse my way through some of these, experimenting with some different conditions, etc. to see where it lands.  I've just fallen into a certain rhythm with my post-processing and I would hate to have to learn a new dance just for the one, new lens.All things considered however, I've been very pleased with most of my results from the 17-85mm thus far....so yeah, worth it.But with respect to ""worth it"":  Canon lists a retail price of $600 for the EF-S 17-85mm IS lens.  Most places online seem to offer it in the $475-$550 range.  As far as lenses go, this is hardly a costly one.  Considering that this is one of the two lenses ""given away"" as the kit lens for Canon's 40D body, you wonder a little bit if the mass-production maybe watered it down just a little bit...?  Just the same, this is a great ""walk-around"" lens:  it is sturdy, has some great built-in features, and has a versatile range of focal lengths.  If you got this lens ""free"" with your camera body then you are in luck.  If you're looking to pick up one separately...  Well, it's a great lens to have.  And I'm happy with mine.  But see if you can't score one on Ebay or through your local re-seller of high-quality, previously enjoyed lenses.Happy shooting, y'all.",How do you like the auto focus?,['the desired focal length' 'The auto-focus is nice'],[1360  893],[1 1],[0. 0.],[False False]

The TV is perfect except for the following things.1) Sometimes the letter buttons on the reverse side of the remote will just stop working. So if you are using the built in YouTube, you might find that you have to manually use the arrows to go to each letter on the screen even though you have all these letter buttons on your remote. They just randomly don't work sometimes.2) Netflix is fine, but YouTube and other apps have serious difficulty streaming for extended periods of time. Even on a 50mbit internet connection, the TV can't seem to buffer the video far enough into the future, and videos play extremely choppy. But this seems to happen more on the 3rd or 4th video you watch, almost like the older videos are being stuck in cache somewhere and now the cache is full, so quitting the app and reloading it makes it better for another two videos... it just seems like they didn't test their included Apps. Maybe this app is provided by YouTube and not vizio, but it is still a part of the TV.3) Automatic volume adjust doesn't work after awhile... the volume will be great, and then sometimes the volume auto adjust feature that is supposed to maintain a constant volume on all content gets screwy, and the volume goes up and down and up and down and up and down while watching movies or videos. Extremely annoying. It can be rectified by either turning the Smart Volume off, or resetting to factory defaults (but then it may randomly return). Turning the Smart volume off would be fine, except when you do this, you may find for certain videos or movies, you will turn the tv volume all the way up to 100% and it will still be quieter than it was when the smart volume was working at 30 or 40%. Basically, your overall maximum volume is seriously reduced. I would say this is the most annoying issue of all with this TV, and if I had known this before hand, I would not have purchased this TV unless I had also purchased a separate audio system.4) About once every 2 months the TV just completely freezes, won't turn off or on until you unplug it. Something about the software on the TV I guess, just has some kind of error and if you are watching TV at the time, the picture gets stuck, and the buttons stop working. You need to unplug the TV and plug it back in. Sometimes it happens when the TV is off, and you can't turn the TV on until you unplug it and plug it back in. This happens without rhyme or reason, but it is rare. Still, it is very annoying when it does happen.5) 3D auto detect is a little poor. It detects fine with certain things like PS3 games, but other things like streaming movies it doesn't detect so well. I'm not sure if other TVs are better at this. It could be a fault of the source.Otherwise, this is a pretty nice TV. I do think it was worth the price at the time I bought it, it was very cheap for the included features. The picture is just fine, and it's big, and the 3D looks good.",What landscape picture do you like?,['the picture gets stuck'],[2250],[1],[0.],[False]

There was no difference in price and I wanted to see the floor model before I bought. But I like the Amazon user reviews, this is my 'go-to' site for user reviews so I want to contribute my experience with this TV.The 60 inch screen is BIG! Not TOO big, mind you, but big enough, and we have a large family room, I think. I'm glad I let my wife talk me out of that 70 inch screen.  It would have overpowered that room. I suspect you won't see many TVs much larger than 70 inches in size in the future, I can't imagine a room in a typical family home that could handle such a screen.  Remember, they look a lot smaller in the showroom! It replaced an old 48 inch 1st gen Panasonic rear projection HD TV that was showing its age (but was plenty big screen wise)Image quality and color is REALLY good, and I have not noticed the narrow angle of view issue that many reviews refer to and I think we have a wide viewing angle in our family room. Image quality is good EVEN when using 75 ohmn coax, IQ with the composite cables are at least as good as with coax.  We have digital, but not HD cable service, so I guess we get our signal in at 480p from cable, but the image is excellent, better than the old Panny.From other user reviews, I had done my research and was prepared to make the needed adjustments that would take care of any lip synch issues I might encounter.  However, I didn't have any lip synch problems.  I wonder if that issue is related to a certain brand or type of cable box.Netflix and Amazon have dedicated buttons on the remote so using them is EASY.  Netflix comes in at 720p as always, and the image is amazing on this TV. I don't use Amazon prime.Regarding the remote, it's pretty cool.  On one side, it is a standard remote with dedicated Netlix and Amazon buttons on the front, and on the flip side,it has a full QUERTY Chicklet type keyboard. On the keyboard side, there are also some gaming type control buttons.  You can download games from the app store (run by Yahoo on behalf of Vizio).  Other apps include Crackle, Hulu+, Vudu, etc. Pretty much similar in variety and in operation to the Roku store. More on this in a bit.The sound is typical tiny and tinny tv sound.  But in defense, the bezel (the frame) around the screen is only about 1/2 inch wide and an inch or so deep, not a lot of space for room filling speakers.  I think we will buy a sound bar for this set eventually.  But I have some spare higher quality PC speakers, in the meantime, I will look into hooking them up.Edit 1/15/13:I've tried to hook up my computer speakers to this TV only to discover that there is no 3.5 mm mini-plug outlet.  There are 2 RCA audio connections on the back and theoretically you can get a converter that converts to a female mini-plug, but Best Buy and HH Greg don't seem to carry them.  I guess I could order from Amazon or other internet vendor, but it seems kind of crazy to pay all that shipping if you don't have other things to buy.  I'll try Radio Shack across town later today.Major problem? No, but a bit of a pain, yes.  The 3.5 mini-plug socket should be part of any device with audio, in my mind.End of Edit:Set up was kind of odd. My Comcast cable box is considered an antenna source if using 75 ohm coax, but a cable connection if using composite cables on the same cable box. (My Comcast Cable box doesn't have HDMI).  The directions could have been clearer on this.I think the User Interface for set up is kind of complex and not very intuitive. I think it could be easier to use. As I said earlier, you have the ability to download apps to the TV from Yahoo even a few games and special Yahoo content apps, however that process seems kind of hidden.  Once you get to it, it works great and it's easy, but getting there is a tad difficult.  That being said, it is unlikely a child would accidentally get there and download something you don't want on your set.The wireless internet connectivity works pretty well.  My wireless router is about 40 feet away on the same floor as the TV.  Set up was relatively easy, but the TV set could be a little better in telling you the status of your connection. I had connected to my router on the first try, but hadn't realized it.  So I kept trying to complete the connection and it kept telling me that all it could find were my neighbor's networks.  Finally I realized it also kept telling me that the network I was on might be a bit slow.  (It isn't, trust me, this, I know) So I tried to get on to Netflix, and son of a gun! it worked!All the confusion aside, once you get the TV set up the way you like, the day to day operation is pretty straight forward and not difficult to use. But getting there could be easier.  Vizio needs to work on the out of box user experience I think.I feel I got a lot for my money, and I would buy it again.  If the users are tech savvy, then they should not hesitate to buy this TV.  But if the users need help setting up a regular tv then they will need someone to help them set this TV up for sure.  But like I said earlier, the day to day operation is pretty easy.  Even grandma should be able to use the set day to day (and even use Netflix and Amazon Prime!)I'm a happy camper with a HUGE TV.",How is it bezel?,"['only about 1/2 inch wide and an inch or so deep, not a lot of space for room filling speakers'

You can use the pinch zoom feature to increase the screen image and zoom in, but this so annoying when you are reading because you have to constantly scroll.

I've had it for a few months and wanted to make sure it wouldn't cheat me before reviewing. Its battery life is quite good--definitely 5+ hours of MP3. The battery indicator is perhaps not fantastic; I've found it run out of juice at times I wouldn't necessarily have expected it. I guess it works, but it's not linear, so don't assume you have half power left when the battery bar is half full (but then most devices are terribly calibrated for battery power, aren't they?).Sound is fine. Frankly, who knows. I use cheap earphones and crank music while working out with this.Radio reception is quite good.The thing is small and light.

Since I listen to a lot of very long tracks I make great use of this. Basically if you hold down to go forward or backward, the longer you hold it the faster it gets. So for example hold it down for five seconds and perhaps it's skipped ahead 1 minute of track. Hold it down 5 seconds more and perhaps 3 minutes of track. Keep holding it down and it starts going ahead minutes at a time, it's a very nice feature and I cannot stress enough how nice this little touch is.

And what it basically comes down to is value.  I have never heard sound as good as these headphones in the $35 range, easily the best under $75.

I loved these so much I ordered two of the 25th Anniversary ones for a bit more.Update: I read some reviews about the PX100-II being much improved and better sounding than the PortaPro.  Since the PX100-II is relatively new, I thought I'd give it another listen.  This time I noticed something different.  The sound is warm, mellow, and neutral, but it loses a lot of detail at the expense of these attributes.  I still prefer higher-detail Portapro, but some may prefer the more mellow sound of the PX100-II.Oh by the way the Portapro comes in the straight plug now, not the angled plug anymore.

Also, the newer version likes to download album art without permission. Personally I don't care for the album art; it just takes up space.

I bought two: one for the XBox 360 and another for the 3D Blu-ray player in the bedroom.  The construction quality is as good, if not better, than the more popular branded HDMI cables. These cables are thick and feel durable.As far as performance goes, I haven't noticed any lag or problems for either 3D gaming or 3D Blu-ray movies.The shipping was fast. The cables came in minimal packaging (no excessive plastic shells to cut through or overload of marketing garbage that tell you zero about the technical specs.The price was what HDMI cables should cost.

Mediabridge seems to have found the perfect balance of quality and cost--I hope they don't change their prices as they gain popularity.I was also surprised to get a thank you e-mail for choosing these cables.

No, the Roku 3 by itself cannot replace all the functions of a cable box but it is a great place to start. The device, about the size of a hockey puck, is truly impressive and functions better than more expensive alternatives.---------------SETUP:From start to finish setup is incredibly easy. I got my Roku up and running in less than 5-minutes. Included in the box are quick-start instructions, the power adapter, the remote (with batteries), and the Roku device. I used a small piece of sticky back Velcro to adhere my Roku to the back of my HDTV, although there are other alternatives sold here on Amazon such as the TotalMount Roku Mounting Kit. The Roku is light enough that even double sided tape would hold the device firmly in place. The only piece you need outside the box is a HDMI cable. The Roku 3 accepts both wired Ethernet and Wi-Fi. I chose the latter and I'm happy to say that Wi-Fi works perfectly. The main reason I avoided the Roku products before the R3 model was because I'd heard complaints of spotty Wi-Fi. This is not the case at all with the Roku 3. My wireless router is in my basement on the other side of my home and the R3 easily picks up a strong signal and delivers content consistently without interruption.Once the device is connected to your television and internet you'll need a computer or internet-enabled device to connect to Roku's website and register the device. This is accomplished via a simple pin-code that you'll type into the website. Once that's accomplished you can start adding channels in addition to those already loaded on the device. For folks who already subscribers to services like Netflix or Amazon VoD you can proceed to sign in or in Amazon's case enable the device by following the on-screen instructions.---------------USE:My wife has been making extensive use of the device as we recently welcomed our first child and she uses the device while at home to stream television shows and movies. The interface is incredibly smooth and very refined. No unnecessary navigation or sub-menus are present. Apps like Netflix, Amazon VoD, Vudu, Hulu, etc. are very responsive and easy to navigate. Comparing the Roku 3 to another device we recently purchased, the Western Digital Live TV Hub is a landslide victory for Roku. Other companies will have to play catch-up to Roku's little device as it's very impressive.--------------What I Love About the Roku 3:(+) The remote is fantastic and doesn't require line-of-sight with the R3 box to operate.(+) The remote has a built-in jack that supports headphones/earbuds. This is a great feature for anyone with kids or poor noise insulation in their home and lets you watch programs without disturbing anyone else.(+) The interface is customizable featuring everything from themes to app tiles that can be changed and adjusted. Best of all, the entire interface isn't slow or clumsy. Button presses on the remote immediately translate to a response on-screen.(+) Universal search. Looking for specific movie or TV show but not sure if it's available on Netflix or Amazon? Universal search allows you to search available channels for your content.(+) The small and inconspicuous design is perfect in our living room where we keep our electronics footprint as light as possible. The R3 is very easy to hide and slim enough to fit behind my wall-mounted HDTV.(+) The quality of the streaming content is consistently superior on the Roku 3 than on a similar device, the Western Digital TV Live Hub. I'm not sure if it comes down to the processor or exactly what. I even have my WDTV Live Hub using a wired Ethernet connection and it still displays an inferior resolution to the R3.(+) Has a built-in USB port for connecting external hard-drives with additional content. Also included is a SD-expansion slot for storing content and additional channels.(+) Andriod/iOS app support that allows you to channel surf, change the channel, or display content from your smart phone on your TV.---------------What I Don't Love about My Roku 3:(-) Does not support non-HDTVs. The inclusion of only HDMI output means that only a suitable HDTV will work with the Roku 3. This is probably less relevant today than it would have been a few years ago but still something to consider for non-HDTV owners. The R3 does not come with a HDMI cable.(-) Limited support for external files. For movies .mkv (h.264) and mp4 (h.264) are supported but nothing else. Supported music file formats include .aac  and .mp3. For photos it's only .jpg and .png.(-) No YouTube channel.---------------Overall:The Roku 3 is a fantastic little device that opens up a world of content at your fingertips. The device is inexpensive yet extremely well refined and polished in a way very few other products in this market have achieved. There are some slight limitations to the device but that shouldn't stop you from purchasing this product. Recommended.---------------UPDATE: 7/2/13: I've been using my Roku 3 for about 3 months and in that time the remote has lost its connection to the base unit twice. I've noticed that on both occasions the remote will suddenly stop responding to certain commands. For example all of the arrow keys and the 'OK' buttons will stop functioning but I can still use the 'back' button. The easiest solution I've found is to simply power off the base unit by unplugging the AC adapter, waiting a few seconds, and plugging the adapter back in. The R3 does come with a troubleshooting guide in the manual that covers pairing a remote with the base unit but it was unnecessary in my experience.",What a good selection for all their products?,"[""There are some slight limitations to the device but that shouldn't stop you from purchasing this product""]",[4887],[1],[0.16666667],[False]

It must also do so reliably for a period of years, but at this early stage I cannot vouch for that. Ease of installation is also essential; a mass storage device should be completely plug-and-play; and it is helpful for it to be preformatted--this one is formatted NTFS for Windows XP and above. These are all the qualities that I want in such a device, but this drive also provides a couple of bonuses: portability and backup software. Although I use the drive with a desktop, portability, i.e. small size and ability to be powered from a USB port, are nice to have anywhere; not having to have an extra cable with a transformer plug that takes up a lot of space on a power strip is a convenience to cheer.As to reliability over a period of years, I have only had my new drive for a week, so I cannot speak to that; however, I will try to make it a point to update this review should the drive fail prematurely (I expect about a five-year lifespan--knock on wood). Thus far, I have written 340 GB of data to it; and from it I have played back HD video (full-frame-rate, full-HD mpeg-type, not just Flash) without a hitch or a glitchAmong these reviews I noticed a lot of complaints about the backup software. They may very well true; and this is not to excuse WD; but I have to say that I have never met a backup program that I liked. Most, including some top-rated, have vital functions that simply don't work. I currently use Windows 7's own backup program; it isn't great--not much flexibility and control; but it's free, and it works (so far).My main motivation for writing this review is to try to provide a little help with installation, which should reassure prospective buyers disturbed by the experiences reported by some other customers. I said above that installing mass storage should be a simple matter of plugging it in, and under the right conditions that is all that this drive requires. But ""under the right conditions"" can be a big ""if""; and a variety of issues can plague the installation of this drive as a USB 3.0 device. In my case, I had never attached a USB 3.0 device to my system before; and I found that Windows would not recognize the device when plugged into a USB 3.0 port. As a search on ""WD Passport USB 3.0 Installation Problems"" reveals, there are several problems that can occur; and dealing with all those is not the purpose of this review; however, I simply want to do two things: (1) reassure you that this device does in fact come with a good USB 3.0 cable, and that it transfers data at a considerably higher speed over USB 3 as compared with USB 2; and (2) to warn the buyer that (s)he may require a driver update for his/her PC. Regarding the first point, I am getting better than 2.5 times the data transfer rate with USB 3.0 versus USB 2. Regarding the second, the updated driver required will most likely be the one associated with the USB hardware on the motherboard of your PC; if you have problems using your WD passport on a USB 3 port, but not on a USB 2 port, visit either your PC vendor's website, or that of the maker of the motherboard, and do a search on USB 3 drivers. WD also provides firmware updates for its drives; but in my case at least, the Passport's firmware was already up to date as received.While I am in the business of giving tips related to the purchase of an external HD, be aware that if you want a hassle-free installation you might want to avoid drives with over 2TB of capacity. I, and others, have had issues, especially with Windows Backup, with 3TB drives. It turns out that the solution is fairly simple: use the WD Quick Formatter tool (available on WD's website) *before* attempting to use the drive (reformatting will wipe out any data you've already put there). As long as you're willing to take that extra step, it's fine to get a 3TB drive; and I have had no further problems with a 3TB drive. To be clear, the drive I am reviewing here is a 2TB drive; but I just thought I'd throw in this extra tip for people who are reading these reviews and are still undecided about what size to get.",Is a great portability?,[],[],[],[],[]

I'm just going to say that the screen looks great, speakers are the best ever, and it's solid.But what I will include in my review is a few opinions.1) the bigger version is better.  Yeah it's the same hardware and software for the most part, but the extra screen space is really really worthwhile.  If you've got *any* spare cash, please consider 8.9 over the 7.2) accessories that should be included.  Amazon was great enough to include a USB cable, but that's it.  No covers, bumpers, screen protect or even a charger.  Yulp, not even a charger.  You do get the option to bundle things at a discount when you buy this, and it's to your best interest to do so.  Pick up the charger for $9.99, because when you change your mind later on, it's $19.99 separately.  Also, if you consider going mobile or throwing it in your purse, consider a screen protector or cover.  It will reduce the greatness of the screen slightly, but you really don't want scratches.  A spare cable is also really nice if you travel a lot.3) Ads.  It really urks me that you have to pay to have ads removed.  This is just amazon milking a little more money from the customer base.  You can find very similar tablets that match features and hardware for $199.99 that doesn't cram advertisements on your device.Overall I would not purchase this device for myself.  I feel that pricing it for $199 is kind of dishonest.  It cost to remove ads, it cost to add a charger, by the time you're said and done it's really closer to $225 before tax.  For relatively the same hardware and features and $199 price tag, I would recommend Nook HD or Nexus 7.  The only plus side is the tight integration to Amazon's electronic services.

I had been in line toget it the very first day it was offered and while it is an adequate device for meia consumption it has its flaws.

The really small amoutn of RAM was also something that immediately caused issues (it has 256 Mb of RAM half of what is available on iphone 4).

An OS that was designed from the ground up for tablet (honeycomb) and an accessory (dock) that seemed to fix everything the device was lacking (keyboard, extra battery, extra expansion ports). On the surface Asus Transformer is an excellent replacement for iPad.It is, however, not a perfect device yet. I 'll admit majority of the issues are software related and should be fixed with the next release (Icecream sandwich). The Tegra processor is fast and 1GB of memory is enough to open a lot of pdfs without any issue.

I finally got around to installing it yesterday.  My initial impressions were not great, to be honest.  The build quality doesn't seem great - mostly lightweight plastic, and the unit is so small and light that the two cables coming out of the back keep the unit from sitting flat on the back of my computer armoire.  I'm OK with that as long as the unit proves to last a long time with few or no reboots needed. It is too early to tell, so I will try to update this review a few months down the road.My next issue with the router came immediately after I finished the setup.  Minutes before unplugging my ZyXel router, I had a reliable network connection on my desktop computer, which has a wired connection to the router.  Upon booting up the Medialink router, I had no network connection and could not even access the router directly through my browser.  I meticulously went through the setup instructions 3 more times, being careful to unplug everything in just the right order.  Still no luck.  I then tried a wireless connection and discovered that did work.  I was able to finish the router setup wirelessly.  I then tried a wired connection from my notebook, and that also worked.  So the router itself seemed to be working fine EXCEPT that I was unable to access it from my desktop, which is a critical need.  I contacted Medialink by email but did not hear back from them quickly so called them.  The initial tech was unable to help. An hour or two later, a level 2 tech called me back and was also unable to help, suggesting that it was a hardware or software issue on my computer.  I then spent 3 hours on the phone with a Dell tech, which was a huge waste of time.  I also submitted questions on a handful of forum sites.  At 11pm, after 14 hours of trying to get this router to work, I tried plugging in the old router, and within minutes I had a working connection again.  Frustrated, I gave up on the new router and went to bed.  This morning, I spent another couple hours doing some troubleshooting before contacting Medialink again by email.  After some time with no response, I called and was told that someone would call me back.  They didn't, but they did respond to my email.  With the new info I provided, they were able to suggest that I wirelessly access the router to change the default IP address from 192.168.0.1 to what my old router had been using (192.168.10.1), then reboot the router.  That worked!  If anyone runs into a similar issue, be sure to give this a shot.  You can change the default IP address by going to Advanced Settings --> LAN Settings on the router.I'm not a hardcore geek, but I'm comfortable with technical things so I was not real happy that I had to invest so much time getting the router to work, nor was I happy about how many emails & phone calls to/from Medialink I had to invest in to get it working.  And I was slightly disappointed in how Medialink came across in their support; I just didn't feel that they were eager & willing to go the distance in helping me resolve this.  HOWEVER, to their credit, they did respond in a reasonably timely fashion, and they did eventually come through with the solution I needed (albeit because I was willing to invest the time & effort to narrow the issues down on my own, something others might not be able or willing to do).In hindsight, I would have gone with a router with a better reputation behind it that offered some additional features, better build quality, and tech support that is able to resolve issues more quickly.  However, for the price, this seems to be a decent router.  I am using 1 wired connection and several wireless devices, and the speed and reliability thus far seem great.  Others have obviously had great success with this, so as long as it continues to work well for me, I have no problems recommending it as a budget router.",How is the configuration?,[],[],[],[],[]

Final conclusion was: No, it is not worth it for me. But it might be for you. Here's why and how I came to my conclusion. I have also included some photos I took with the 7D and the 1.4 lens.I have been able to work with the 1.2 before, and was ready to buy my own. Buying the 1.2 was quite a leap, but I knew it would do the job. I researched the 1.4 hoping it could be just as good but for a lot less. What helped me come to my final decision to purchase the 1.4 was a website by Jim Arnold - [...] It has examples of the same shots using both lenses! I was worried that I would want the 0.2 difference in the lens, and I would miss it with the 1.4. But I must say that is not the case at all! This site has a ton of examples using the different lenses. He includes photos taken at f1.2, f1.4, and f2.8Bokeh on the 1.4 - One of the photos I added shows the bokeh of the 1.4. The 1.4 has 8, the 1.8 has 5. The 1.2 has also has 8 blades but produces a little bit smoother bokeh. But when I tested the bokeh on the 1.4 I was not disappointed. The difference was not all that obvious.Why not the f1.8 lens? I would say it's a great starter lens - so if that is what you want then go for it! But I have had friends who have owned this lens to only have it completely fall apart after only 1 year. The 1.8 AF is loud and slow. The 1.4 has a much sturdier build than the 1.8 with better auto focus and less noisy. From experience I would say that the 1.4 can even focus better in low light than the 1.2.The 1.4 is lighter than the 1.2 and feels better on the camera in my opinion - weight feels more evenly dispersed.For shooting video with 1.4 - it focuses better in low light than the 1.2, making shooting a low light scene easier. The 1.4 makes for some pretty footage.1.2L cons - size, weight, high price - And not all that different from the 1.4.1.2L pros - beautiful bokeh, sharpest of these 3 lenes, well made1.4 cons - bokeh not as good as 1.2, but better than 1.8. A little less sharp (but I haven't noticed that personally)1.4 pros - good price, quality, not too different than the 1.2 in picture quality1.8 cons - plastic build, slow and noisy AF, choppy bokeh with 5 blades over 8 in the 1.2 and 1.41.8 pros - great price, great starter lensI enjoy my 1.4 lens VERY much and I am glad I chose it over the 1.2. You need to decide what is important to you when picking a lens. In my case the $1000 price difference just did not make the 1.2 worth it.

Once set up, features were not as robust as the Linksys and the one I really wanted was the ability to set up a guest connection since we often have house guests.  The Linksys also has the ability to recognize and prioritize devices but I end up needing that less than I thought I would.Performance was solid.  We have Webpass internet service (highly recommended) with speeds of 100mbs upload and download and this router did very well.  On the 5.0 ghz band, the wireless signal did not travel quite as far as the linksys but still made it throughout the primary 12 foot radius of the router.Overall I would probably go with this TP-Link if I had to buy all over again.",Why do I have a large footprint?,[],[],[],[],[]

I rooted and then installed the android operating system; it kind of liberated the tablet. It was more responsive, but development of the community was slow because the touchpad was not that popular. Reading on the tablet was really good, but forget about reading in your bed this thing was heavy.  So I decided to sell the HP touchpad. Decided that I was either going to go for the kindle fire HD or nexus 7. I looked at both devices and I was impressed with the performance of both. But the nexus 7 was king in performance.  But what I really disliked was the screen and the storage space of the nexus 7.  So I knew I was going to use the tablet to the maximum so I went with the kindle fire hd because it offered more space. As it is now I only have 6.78 GB left after everything I have done to the tablet.Kindle fire HD ""7"" The reason why I rooted===================================I ended up rooting my kindle fire.  There are tutorials on YouTube and xda developers.  I always like rooting the cell phones and tablets I get my hands on. My hd2 was rooted so many times (rip hd2 best cell phone ever). If could I would root my ti-89 titanium.  So I could not resist myself I had to root my KFHD. Its good feeling that the community is there to help expand the horizons of the product you paid money for. That's the main reason I did not go for the ipad 3. There just so much you can do with the android platform.  There were a lot of apps missing from the kindle store so I had to root the KFHD.Performance=====================The KFHD is pretty snappy, fast I would say.  Sometimes scrolling through the carousel it stutters.  But for the majority of time it's really good. The silk browser is a total lag fest.  So just installed the dolphin browser and wow now that's fast.  Smooth scrolling and pinch to zoom in.It takes a few seconds for the YouTube app to load completely. Also Google maps takes a few seconds to locate your position. When I mean a few seconds like 10 seconds or less. I am not sure why this is happening.  After loading everything is fine.I put some movies files avi and they played fine. They played really nice with dice player.N64oid works really good on the kindle fire hd. Mario kart 64 and ps3 controller work beautifully on kindle fire HD.  Gaming overall is great on the kindle fire hd. I was playing dead trigger and I did not see any frame drop and overall enjoyable game. played mass effect infiltrator, asphalt 7 ($.99), shadowgun, and they were running fine. i will try later FPSE see how that goes.Display=======================I like the display colors pop and I like reading a lot on the screen. There is a lot of reflection with sun light so that kind of spoils the fun.  The movies look great on the display no problems here. Also games look really nice on the kindle fire hd. Overall I like the display.Holding volume down + power button at the same time takes a picture of your display.I kind of like the carousel but If could I would want my apps to just show on the main screen like normal android.  I just don't see the point to carousel.  But whatever the case adw launcher ex  is always there.Battery========================The battery last a long time.  I did not mind that they gave us a mini usb cable for the for the kindle fire hd. I used by hd2 charger for the kindle fire it charges fine and fast enough for me.  Why can't customers have the choice to change their own battery? The hp was like this, also the nexus 7.  Why are they copying apple?Sound=================Wow sound is legit on this device. Really loud. Overall really impressed on the sound. Headphone is really good too. Sound is not a problem. 5 stars.  No much to say other than amazon did it right.Camera================Camera is ok , its just whatever.  It nice that it is there. I downloaded from android market camera ics and you can take pictures and videos from the app.  Can control zoom in functions with the apps, also share via Bluetooth, and email via Gmail.Bluetooth================It limited to what it can connect. I could not connected to my ps3 Bluetooth headset.  I could not make it connect to my computer which had a Bluetooth usb. So I guess I ll need to find some devices and meeting the requirements of the KFHD7.Ads==========Ads don't bother me, but I wish they were maybe related to what I liked. But If I feel like they are in my way, since I am already rooted then I remove them manually. Was actually really funny I was showing off my kindle fire hd to someone, and as soon as I turned the kindle there was big titanic advertisement as my lock screen picture, so it was really awkward, I was like uhhhh  yeah I don't like titanic.  Maybe some gamer advertisements would be nice. Xbox 360 or ps3 gaming advertisements.Apps that work after rooting=============================Youtube  v4.1.23Gmail  v4.1.2Google earth 7.0.0.7386Google maps v6.12.0Google talkGroove ip liteCamera icsAutocad ws (looked really good on the kindle fire hd) for any engineers out thereDead trigger ( can play now with ps3 controller)Graph 89 free (like having a ti 89 titanium  but with color )Mass effect infiltratorShadow gun ( can play now with ps3 controller)N64oid (nintendo 64 emulator ( can play now with ps3 controller))Sixaxis controller now I can use my ps3 controller with kindle fire hdDice player to watch avi movies.Adw launcher ex works but if you hit home button it reverts back to the carouselAny app you can think of from the android storeOverall===========All I can say is that I like my kindle fire hd.  I really like that I put some physics books, math books, engineering books, carry them all and read on that nice display. I can then use an app like graph 89 and upload ti 89 titanium operating system on app, it kind of replaces my actual ti 89 titanium. I load some games and so far I like playing games with my ps3 controller. i watched rango, true grid, iron man 2, defiance, mission impossible, and all can say is I like the display and the sound. The performance is great but not perfect. Bluetooth left something to be desired. Rooting the device opens a lot of doors.  I would recommend the device; I would rate it over all 4 stars.  You get a free month of amazon prime.  I think I ll get the amazon prime membership was using my brother one.other notes============as jsh1120 pointed out rooting the device does void your warranty unless you can revert (in some cases you can). please research before doing anything. the youtube tutorial is fairly simple to follow, but if you have never rooted a device before this might be challenging.****Rooting the device will NOT kill your amazon prime instant video streaming capabilities******* amazon prime video streaming is working fine after rooting, i am watching my free movies just fine.update 10/6/2012=================i bought a mini hdmi to hdmi, the kindle fire hd looks really good on the tv, it amazing, i was able to play some n64 games with the ps3 controller in the big tv. brought some nostalgia memories.search youtube ""kindle fire hd Rooted with google apps"" i uploaded this video showing what kindle can do, please note is laggy because i was recording through vnc, and i had no camera.",How is the price?,[],[],[],[],[]

When the Nexus 4 came out I decided to give it a shot and I loved it. I started using my iPad less and less because I enjoyed Android so much. Getting an Android tablet was next on my list, but I really wanted to wait for the 2013 Nexus 7 before trying it out. Once the Nexus 7 was announced, I quickly ordered one.The very first thing I noticed when taking it out of the box was its weight, or lack of. This thing is amazingly light and amazingly thin. Of course, the whole &#34;lighter and thinner&#34; quote is often said by Apple, but it can be easily applied to the new Nexus 7.Of course, the screen is another great thing about it. The 323 ppi is just 3 ppi short of the retina display on the iPhone. And for a device that will typically be held further away than a 4&#34; screen, this display is fantastic. It can be extremely bright and colors look fairly good so far. Viewing angles are pretty good. But my biggest complaint about the screen is how glossy it is. I would love to see more manufacturers start to implement the same kind of anti-glare glass that was put on the RMBP. Of course, this is dependent on Gorilla Glass, but hopefully they will start trying to decrease glare. Also, fingerprints get pretty obvious after a fair amount of use. But that is to be expected. The back of the device also seems to enjoy fingerprints. But this doesn't bother me on the back. And the back of the device has a nice finish to it making it comfortable to hold.The weight, size, and resolution of the Nexus 7 makes it a fantastic eReader. However, when it comes to web browsing the screen does feel small. This makes me wish it was a Nexus 8 instead of a Nexus 7, but I guess that could have increased the price. This is one area where I think Apple did a great job. Just a 1&#34; difference really does a lot to improve overall user experience when browsing the web. Sure, you can argue resolution, ppi, and throw all sorts of small numbers at the iPad Mini to make it look awful in comparison. But the screen size and aspect ratio really make it a great device for browsing the web and reading.When it comes to movies, the Nexus 7 is great. Although the 16:10 aspect ratio means you will still see black bars on the top and bottom on nearly every movie you watch. But the sound coming from the Nexus 7 is amazing. Google and Asus did a great job with dual speakers. However, in landscape mode the speakers are right where you are going to put your hands. So you may end up muffling the sound a little bit. The front bezels would have made a much better spot to put the speakers. Then they would have at least had some sort of excuse for the Texas-sized bezels. In fact, I watched a review online and the new Nexus 7 is taller than the old one. Meaning the top and bottom bezels are slightly bigger than last year!The simulated surround sound is a nice addition. And music sounds great. With movies, I have them all on Plex. So I am not sure how the Nexus 7 handles audio playback through Plex when watching a movie. And I know this may never happen, but it would be great if Google could do what they did with Google Music to personal movie collections. Obviously they would be worried about pirated movies. But I have a lot of DVDs that I got on my computer using HandBrake. And having that kind of functionality would be great. But I'm not holding my breath.The cameras seem to be decent. I have not tested them extensively yet, but for a tablet all you really need cameras for are for video chatting. And every video chat service will have to decrease the quality for streaming anyways.Wireless charging is a cool addition. It seems to work with my Nexus 4 wireless charger. However, I am still not a fan of Qi charging. Calling it wireless is just deceptive. Are wires still involved? Yes. Thus, not wireless. Plus using it on a wireless charger makes it much more difficult to use while the device is charging. If I have my Nexus 7 plugged into the cable, I can still play games that use the accelerometer. Can't easily do that with a wireless charger. Plus wireless chargers take longer to completely charge the device.Battery life is hard to determine at the moment since I just got it. I will need to update this section when I have more time with the device.Now that I have used it a full day, battery life isn't as good as I had hoped. Not even close really. I will post screen shots.The 2GB RAM and S4 Pro help the Nexus 7 feel speedy. However, it is still not perfectly smooth. Some parts of the UI will encounter some hiccups every now and then. Specifically dealing with the recent apps button and in some cases the home button freezing for a second or two. Nothing major, but this device still encounters minor lag.I find it odd that there is no vibrator motor in the Nexus 7. Sure, it may not be a priority, but adding one couldn't cost too much.Now that I have gone over the hardware, time to touch on the software. Android 4.3 is a minor update, and maybe it should have just been 4.2.3.Tablet app selection is still far inferior to iPads. Although, the Nexus 7 feels less like a tablet and more like a large phone. I'm not really sure how to explain this part, but is just doesn't feel like a tablet. Of course, 7&#34; is considered the smallest size screen a tablet can be, so I guess that makes sense. But when you have 5&#34; phones, 10&#34; tablets, and then a device with a 7&#34; screen, the screen size is closer to phones than tablets.Most apps work fine and are the exact same as the phone app, just scaled up. Some of the default Google Apps, like People and Calendar, are slightly different. But they feel squeezed, especially People.When it comes to third party apps, most function fine. However, Evernote keeps crashing on me. It will not open at all. Same with Slice. Whether or not this is due to Android 4.3 or the device itself, I don't know. Maybe someone can shed some light on this?Also, I am starting to find apps that are incompatible with the Nexus 7. I have never had this problem before with the Nexus 4. But one game I play quite often, Blitz Brigade, is not compatible. What's weird is that the Nexus 7 has the same CPU and RAM as the Nexus 4! Why it is incompatible I have no idea. But this is very frustrating.Ultimately, the best things about the Nexus 7 are its price, screen, and speakers. Android is a great phone OS, but it just doesn't feel as good on a tablet. The Android tablet experience definitely feels lacking in certain ways. But I expect this to improve as the OS matures.One thing in particular I do not like about the tablet experience is the lack of synchronized notifications. For example, I just got a notification from the default calendar app about an event coming up. I got the notification on both my Nexus 7 and Nexus 4. And I have the same Google Calendar synced on both devices. Yet if I dismiss the notification on one device, I am still required to dismiss it on the other device. Synchronized notifications is something that is sorely needed in Android.The Nexus 7 is a great and affordable way to get a foot in the Android tablet arena. If you are on the fence about it, you should definitely buy it and give it at least a week and see how you like it.",Where can I get a form factor of a PDA?,[],[],[],[],[]

Granted, Logitech has a history of making good keyboards that feel and work well even after years of prolonged use. In fact, despite occasional forays into other brands, I've always come back to them. It's gotten to the point where I'd pretty much consider myself brand-loyal.The downside to their products is they're usually more expensive than the competition. There aren't many choices for bluetooth keyboards with memory- the only other one I found was IOGear's Multi-link keyboard. That one looked technically superior in some respects, e.g. it has a trackpad and 6-device memory. It's also about half the price, and I'll admit I was (again) sorely tempted to jump the brand boat and check it out. However, I decided not to due to the fact that I'd probably use a bluetooth mouse anyway, and I don't plan on using this with any more than 3 devices anyhow. Plus, the Logitech K810 has some advantages of its own- namely that it's backlit, rechargeable, and can actually detect when your hands are on it for power management.The keyboard itself is both compact and slim, and is very attractive. It also feels great typing on it despite the fact that it's a compact keyboard. The keys are very quiet in general and the backlighting works well. It lasts a good amount of time on a charge (usually about 2 weeks if you use the backlight), and is rechargeable via micro USB. The keyboard layout is pretty standard, with 3 F keys serving the dual purpose of switching devices and the others to control various functions like backlight intensity and volume control. You switch to the regular F# functionality via a FN key.Switching devices is the big draw of this keyboard, and it works very well- practically instantaneously. The keyboard seems to have memory, so if you type while switching it will backlog the keystrokes. Pairing was also straightforward- there is a standard pairing button on the bottom, and after pushing it you select which device setting to use, then pair as usual. The keyboard also has a manual power switch if you're going to store it. Overall, it works very well in general.The keyboard does lay flat (and only flat) so in that respect it's very similar to Apple's bluetooth keyboards. The feel of this one is different from Apple's but very nice in general- it's comfortable to type on for long periods of time and doesn't take long to get used to. Build quality appears to be very solid- no clattering if you shake it, and although I wouldn't toss it around the room it does look capable of taking a few drops.I've used quite a few bluetooth keyboards over the years, including older Logitechs, cheap ones by Anker, and Apple's. This is definitely my favorite one so far. The switching function and backlighting make it pretty unique, and I would say it's worth the high price.",What is the easy key?,[],[],[],[],[]

But man, does this come close!  I have never been so happy with a camera -- and I've owned quite a few.Right off the bat, the sensor size is larger than on your average P&S; (point and shoot) camera, but the resolution isn't any higher.  This allows the camera to take MUCH better pictures in low light.  And you will be amazed at how good this camera is in low light!  Short of a DSLR camera, it has no equal.In addition, this camera is built for the serious enthusiast.  Full manual controls make it almost like having a DSLR in your pocket!  And there is a control dial plus a control ring -- making it much easier to control your settings.  Plus, a fast lens and the ability to shoot in RAW ... no wonder so many photographers consider this the best pocket camera available.  And yet, you can keep it in Auto mode and treat it like any other point & shoot.Oh, and the LCD is truly beautiful!The main thing that keeps it from being ""perfect"" in my estimation is the limited zoom: less than 4X.  I need much more zoom.  But I'd give it all up for this camera!  And, if you want to use the camera as a camcorder, the standard definition video mode is a bit disappointing.  Why not high-def, Canon?The main problems with the camera are pretty minor.  The control dial on the back is very loose and you have to be careful not to accidentally change your settings.  It's also a shame that you can't independently set the control dial and control ring for whatever you want: instead, you have to choose among a number of pre-sets.  It's a little disappointing.  And, if you are very serious, it's worth noting the serious barrel distortion in RAW; but the camera takes care of that in processing JPEGs, so most will never know.Some people complain about the build quality.  Trust me, it's perfectly fine.  It's light, which can be misleading.  But there's nothing wrong with the build quality.  Perhaps they expect more for $400.  I guess I can understand that.  But I'm perfectly comfortable with the build quality.The competition for this camera are the Panasonic LX3, the Fujifilm F200EXR, and maybe the Sony WX1 or TX1.  The Sonys are good low-light cameras, but have no manual controls.  The LX3 and the F200EXR are more serious cameras, but they are no better than the S90 and much more difficult to use.  The S90 seems to get things right right out of the box more often than these others ... from all that I have heard, anyway.  I don't have any of these cameras.  But don't discount ease of use when you consider the competition.I give this camera the highest recommendation possible, even if it's not quite perfect!",How is the photo?,['course' 'MUCH better pictures in low light'],[  3 327],[1 1],[0. 0.],[False False]

I especially liked the simple remote control which is not overwhelming. However the wireless connectivity was a little difficult and very finicky. The wireless router is located about 20 feet away, and we've never had any problem conencting with laptops or iPhones/iPods. However, I had to fidget with the placement of the Roku and attempted 2-3x before connecting finally. It then downloaded an update and after it rebooted, it lost the wireless connection again. So I fidgeted with the placement again until it connected. Then I tried to setup NetFlix and the wireless had dropped again, so I reconnected, got the activitation code and it validated the Roku box. Thankfully, you cannot turn the Roku off so hopefully once it's connected, it stays connected or tries to reconnect. I am hoping it was just the initial setup that was slightly flakey. To be on the safe side, I made sure the wireless router and the Roku had as few electronic obstacles around it. I am very impressed with the streaming technology and how the Roku is able to buffer the streaming so the movie is shown smoothly and crisply. It does look so much better than watching NetFlix on the PC or Wii. I also have Netflix on the PS3 and Xbox360 and I find the quality comparable. Another great feature is that the audio is turned on for BOTH HDMI and left/right audio cables so you can run the sound to the receiver and TV. Unfortunately, I ran out of optical inputs on the receiver but I'm assuming that toslink connection is always on as well. I have high hopes that my mother will be able to use the Roku, and once Netflix starts providing closed-captioning on the Roku, it will be even more useful! I am just concerned about the wireless connectivity but if it does prove to be a problem, my solution would be to run ethernet straight to the Roku or wire the electrical outlets with Netgear PowerLine equipment (they seem to provide very good results).",How was your experience?,[],[],[],[],[]

My initial experience with the drives were good. They performed well and were quiet. However, within 9 months I had two failures. Both failures were immediate and showed no error conditions prior to their failure. Due to the RAID 5 configuration, I didn't experience data loss. Seagate replaced both drives without question, although I still had to cover shipping to send the failed drives to Seagate.Before my 2 TB drive failures, I purchased a Seagate 3 TB drive as part of an upgrade OWC did on my iMac. From the day the drive was installed, I had problems with OS and application stability. Within 9 months, the 3 TB Seagate drive had failed. I asked that OWC replace the failed Seagate drive with a Hitachi 2 TB drive. The iMac has been stable ever since.My conclusion from just my experience, is that Seagate drives have an unusually high failure rate when compared to the same number of Hitachi drives I've deployed. Seagate replaces failed drives without any pushback, but I'm uncomfortable placing critical data on the replacement drives. I end up deploying them into non-critical transient storage or as part of a layered backup strategy. To date, all of the replacement drives Seagate has sent me are performing well.Update: Two months after Seagate sent me a replacement for the 3 TB drive, the replacement has failed. The replacement drive is flagged as being out of warranty, even though the drive is only two months old. I don't expect that I will buy another Seagate product again.",What is a quick and accurate review?,[],[],[],[],[]

The refurbished unit was like new btw. But having grown accustomed to my previous 7"" 1st gen Fire, this is just right. There are also minute differences on the keyboard, etc. between the sizes that I was already used to. I think the 8.9 is too big and heavy; and this one is just right :) Love Fire in general, and enjoying all the new functions, especially the audiobook/ebook synchronization, as well as the new standard text-to-speech voice which is certainly improved on the original. I am also for the first time typing on the bluetooth keyboard which paired perfectly once I figured it out and types amazingly comfortably (by Amazon), plus the original (leather) Amazon case (in blue); the difference in price between the sizes allowed me those extras (and a charger). Works great. Also there is a phone app so you can make and receive calls. 5-Star performance! :)Update:  I returned this unit for a refurbished non-HD (gen. 2) Fire. I just don't think the HD adds anything (the screen of my original Fire is perfectly responsive and visually; it doesn't have the slight pauses or glitches of the HD. I reasoned the 10-point touch screen & HD-quality ""video card"" (or whatever a Fire has) takes more RAM and software to operate, hence possibly accounting for the difference from my *perfect* 1st gen. unit. I watch Netflix and HD-quality YouTube videos on my 1st gen. and honestly don't see a difference. I also know the refurbished units are just as fine and functional as new ones. I got two more cases with the deal, one being a duplicate of my favorite which is hard ""fabric"" that completely zips around unit and has no ""straps"" (Marware beige)Marware jurni Kindle Fire Case Cover, Beige (does not fit Kindle Fire HD)Most of the new features like text ebook/ audiobook synchronization (immersion reading) are included in the new (2nd gen.) software and I'm hoping the new text-to-speech voice software is as well. They are not HD-dependent. Of course I am sacrificing Bluetooth functionality (keyboard, separate speakers), HDMI-out for a larger screen, and one App that allows you to use the device as a phone; probably the microphone is missing too, and of course the camera is (mine was too dark and grainy anyways, not nearly as good as a built-in laptop cam for example). So, no Skype on the non-HD if those features matter to you (the phone App was neat).My main beef was the screen, again in the HD 7"" Fire was yellow, with less contrast (for text ebooks) than my 1st gen. which I far preferred. Mostly I use my Fire for reading ebooks, and that was what was important to me. I keep my half-way brightness setting, and it's always sufficient. Secondly I browse websites and videos, and my 1st gen. is nimble & quick and perfectly capable. So I'm hoping the 2nd gen. I have now ordered will have the hardware designs I prefer with *some* of the new features (software). I can only hope for the quicker, brighter screen; I know the interface has been updated to the new standard which I found equally useful to the original. It is shipping now... :) As a small last insertion, the Kindle (ebook reading software) function, in the updated version, covers the text of your ebook with the menu enabled at the top, more like the Kindle White. The old Fire doesnt do this; it does, however, do it on the bottom. This will be the same between the HD and 2nd gen., so just a minor irritation. Btw, I received the sale price of $169 here so the difference in price between the HD and non-HD unit was a non-issue.I removed one star for the more yellow, darker screen with less ebook text contrast.",How big is the unit?,[],[],[],[],[]

I am quite pleased that developers are pushing back game release dates; that means that they know that their product isn't ready for launch, and they want to give the gamers the best experience possible. Rushing to market benefits no one.There are a few issues, such as lack of DLNA or MP3 support, which will likely be fixed with a software update. I honestly know few gamers that used it - this is a gaming machine, not a home theater. It was just not on Sony's radar. My SmartTV has all that built into it, so I don't really care either way.There was also a lot of whining about defective units. Assuming sony had a 1% failure rate, that means 10,000 defective units for every 1,000,000 - and we all know that unhappy people are the loudest. The industry level for acceptable failure is about 4%. Current Sony Failure rates are around 0.4%, so I don't put much stock in the &#34;they're all broken&#34; drama. Now, I'll be the first to say that I'm no fanboy, but I got seriously shafted with the last Microsoft offering that had a 50%+ failure rate. Thanks, after that, I'll take my business elsewhere. If they've learned, good for them. Maybe I'll consider them again in 8 years when the next &#34;console war&#34; kicks off.After hours of being impressed with graphical depth and loading speeds, I've noticed that my PS4 hardly makes a peep and is consistently nothing more than warm. No small feat for the small footprint, and the amount of power the unit pushes. The dashboard is a bit weird at first, but what new system isn't. The social networking features are neat, but will be more useful when more people adopt the console, and I've been relatively impressed with the Vita's remote play functionality (if nothing else, I have a free second controller).Aside from a few software glitches that I'm sure are being worked on, I'm extremely satisfied with my purchase, and the fact that for the same price as an XBO, I got an extra game. Things will only get better as both big box and indie developers get familiar with the architecture and start cranking out some awesome games. Ground breaking? No. Breath taking? Maybe. A worthy purchase for a hardcore gamer? Definitely. If nothing else, the DualShock4 is an absolute revelation - a pleasure to use for hours on end, and the headphone jack is remarkably smart. (Protip: the controller uses BT, so the headphone jack is stereo. If you want 7.1 quality sound in headphones, pick up some Astro A40s/A50s if you don't already own them... which you should if you're a hardcore gamer). The included mic is a nice gesture, but, please don't use it unless the rooms is extraordinarily quiet - it is not noise cancelling.In the end, most of the amazing games are cross-platform anyway, so it is really win-win as far a games go. I'm pleased that Sony is still allowing internet access for free (just not multiplayer gaming, which is fair since servers aren't free). I happily pay the PSN+ fee, regardless and have amassed quite a free game library.The next generation is not a big leap forward in graphics, but instead, a leap forward in gaming. Everything that wraps the game has been upgraded and streamlined, making for a much more immersive experience (streaming gameplay, social interactions, how the game interacts with you, etc.). Don't expect the launch-title graphics to wow you - they probably will not for a year or two- but do expect to have a different experience than with your previous generations of console.",What is thing?,[],[],[],[],[]

It may also serve well as a working drive that's used more intensively but for temporary or replaceable files - such as a scratch drive or a media server.This drive is large enough and priced low enough that you can backup multiple computers for not a lot of money.However, if you're looking for an expansion drive - a second drive to augment a laptop or desktop - that you will use intensively, consider options with cooling and perhaps backup, especially if you will use the drive for your only copy of files.A DESKTOP DRIVE:  This is a desktop drive, not a truly portable drive.  You could use it to backup multiple computers around a home or office, but you're not going to enjoy carrying the drive and the power supply.A FAST CONNECTION:  USB 3.0 really is fun to use, if you have the right port on your computer to use it.  No more sitting around watching file transfers - the speeds are similar to those of a built in drive.KEEP A BACKUP: One of the keys to happiness in modern life is to keep at least two copies of every computer file you need.  If you have anything you would rather not have vanish tomorrow, get a hard drive - any hard drive - and make a copy. Right now.  Err on the side of caution.ALL HARD DRIVES FAIL - SO REPLACE THEM BEFORE THEY DO:  Hard drives are complex mechanical devices. They will absolutely, inevitably fail.  So manage them accordingly.I replace all my drives after about three to four years (if they survive that long).  It's much easier to replace a drive before it fails - it's very easy to copy a readable drive.  It's much harder to recreate a drive, especially a boot drive, after it fails - you need to reinstall all the software and settings, and maybe reconstruct the folder structure.And hard drives are cheap enough to make it not worth the risk to keep drives around longer than that.  I can usually get a bigger, faster drive for much less money than the original drive.Once you start to accept the reality that hard drives will fail, and manage your drives and data appropriately, you can drastically reduce the disruption that hard drive failures cause.BUY A GOOD MODEL OF DRIVE, THEN KEEP A CURRENT BACKUP:  As much as people like to claim that particular brands are better or worse, statistics don't really seem to back that up.  Buy a good model from one of the top brands - Seagate, Western Digital, Hitachi, Samsung - and then manage them as described above.That being said - some drives (or the firmware they are shipped with) have turned out to be real lemons.  Most of the big manufacturers make good drive models, and they have made bad drive models.  So much like your uncle, who never bought a new model car until they'd worked the bugs out of it - let someone else be at the bleeding edge of hard drives.  Buy models that have been tested by other users.It's a little soon to tell for the drive installed in this particular model, and some of the early feedback is mixed.COOLING QUESTIONS:  I can't really figure out why the cooling is so unconvincing on almost all external drives (like this one).  A tight-fitting plastic case, with no effective ventilation?  Really?  While drive temperature isn't perhaps quite as big an issue as some would make it out to be - that level of cooling just doesn't seem adequate for a drive that's running more than a fraction of the time.  If your needs fit that description - that is, if you need a back up drive, or an intermittently used expansion drive - then this Seagate external drive may be a good matchFOR AN INTENSIVELY USED EXPANSION DRIVE, CONSIDER OTHER OPTIONS:  If you need more space in an expansion drive, and plan to use the drive intensively, consider other options.  Perhaps a NAS (network attached storage) or a drive enclosure with more effective cooling, and possibly something with multiple drives and built in backup.WATCH HOW YOUR DRIVES ARE SHIPPED:  One of the key factors in whether a drive will last is how it's handled and shipped.  External drives such as this one are usually packaged somewhat well, although online vendors still don't seem to really get the concept of filling the shipping box so the product inside doesn't bounce around on its way to you.",How is the quality of the datum?,[],[],[],[],[]

And missing parts. This had me worried.that i would receive a product that would be poorly made. And it took 3 days just to start the shipping process. Figured they were throwing stuff in a box as they went. The box they used was a commercial box it wasn't like they just threw it in a paper bag.My experience was completely opposite. They provide you with more than enough bolts. Every tv is different they cant possibly match every TV in the world. But they sure did their best they offered 3 different sizes of mounting bolts. Everything was neatly labeled in plastic bags by letter, and part name.The instructions were so simple a 3 year old could do it. As with all machined equipment best advice is if something isn't lining up DONT TRY TO FORCE IT. Just think it thru turn it like a puzzle until things line up perfect.That being said, there were a few down sides that i've also seen from other comments. The adjustment of the swivel makes no sense to me. If you adjust it then the locking pin wont line up or the screws wont line up.. something wont line up if you swivel it.Finally the safety pins are a pain in the you know what to screw in if you have a thin tv. It's so close to the wall. And i wouldn't suggest not tightening them as any upward motion to the tv you risk the thing falling down. I had to find a socket that would fit around my screw driver, attach the socket to an extension arm... just to be able to reach the screw.I'd suggest that Cheetah consider making some sort of an extension rod that can be used to help reach them. Even if it's just a solid bar with a Phillips head on the end and a nut on the other that you can attach a socket wrench to and use it to reach the screws.I'm not sure how much this would raise the cost, and i  commend them on how many extra bolts and washers they provide. Those have to add up over time. just to have the extras thrown away.Another note, by the advise of my father who helped me hang the thing, an ex carpenter, we ditched the anchors since we were drilling into studs. Just drilled a pilot hole(tiny hole) and used a ratchet to screw the lag screw in. From doing minimal research on the internet(and i suggest you do the same) anchors are only needed for concrete or if you cant find the stud.Long story short, i  had a pleasant experience.

You may consider this product if you have TWO devices that support HDMI 1.4. For these, the cable will carry through HD images and Ethernet data therefore eliminating the need for one dedicated Ethernet cable and one Ethernet port. Again, on a pair of connected HDMI 1.4 devices, it will eliminate the need of a dedicated audio cable if, let's say, your TV needs to send sound back to your receiver - it may have a built-in Blu/DVD player or get its input through an USB port. You may also consider this cable if you currently need an extra HDMI 1.3 cable but you are planning to to replace your existing equipment with some HDMI 1.4 ready hardware in the near future.As far as HDMI 1.4 stands, this cable is 'it'. It's the complete implementation because it supports ALL HDMI 1.4 features.HOW GOOD IS IT?- Behaves as a HDMI 1.3x 'high speed' or 'category 2' cable.- As a 'high speed' HDMI 1.4 cable, it supports video resolutions of at least 1080p and can go as high as 4K.- The 'data channel' (Ethernet support) works only with HDMI 1.4 ready equipment.- The 'audio return channel' is another feature supported by HDMI 1.4 ready equipment only. It will allow for audio to be sent 'back' from, let's say a TV to the HDMI 1.4 compliant receiver, therefore eliminating the need for a dedicated audio cable.- It should support all the HDMI 1.4 extra color palettes because those are implemented by the HDMI 1.4 compliant connected equipment.You may want to get this cable even if your equipment is not HDMI 1.4, it doesn't hurt to get a wire that supports a higher standard and, with free shipping the price difference is not that great. And, keep in mind that Amazon stands behind this product so returns should be easy.END OF REVIEW______________________________________________________What follows is the byproduct of me attempting to clarify 'HDMI 1.4' for myself and understanding this specific product's features. I thought I'd share.WHAT'S IN A NAME? (understanding this cable's features)- HDMI 1.4 is a new HDMI standard adopted in 2009, backward compatible with HDMI 1.3. This cable should work with your existing equipment.- HIGH SPEED indicates that this cable supports resolutions of 1080p or higher and 3D video (unlike the HDMI 1.4 STANDARD cables which, believe it or not, are limited to 720p/1080i - why? nobody knows).- ETHERNET means that this cable supports a full-duplex 100 Mb/sec Ethernet connection - if you have 2 HDMI 1.4 ready devices and they both need an network connection, this cable will carry through the Ethernet datastream to the second device, therefore saving you the need for one extra Ethernet cable.- Audio Return Channel is a feature that would save you the need of a dedicated audio cable between 2 HDMI 1.4 compliant devices.- This cable should support the full set of 3D features found in the new TVs.THE HDMI 1.4x DIFFERENCEHDMI 1.4 allows for the following new features:- Ethernet Channel - allows for the 2 connected devices to communicate with each other and share one network connection.- Audio Return Channel - eliminates the need of a second cable if you want to send audio from your TV back to your receiver.- 3D - It's supported by HDMI 1.3x but HDMI 1.4a specifically supports all the currently agreed-upon industry standards- 4K resolution - good to have it but there is nothing on today's market that would take advantage of this- Expanded support for new color spaces - by supporting sYCC601, AdobeRGB, and AdobeYCC601 it better aligns your display with the color spaces supported by digital cameras.- Type D connector - the 'Micro' connector is to be used by small, portable devices with supported resolutions of up to 1080p.The HDMI Consortium defines 4 broad types of HDMI 1.4 cables:* Standard HDMI Cable* High Speed HDMI Cable* Standard HDMI Cable with Ethernet* High Speed HDMI Cable with EthernetOf the above, only the 'High Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet' (this one) makes sense and it's likely to emerge as the common HDMI 1.4 cable.Standard cables are limited to lower-resolution displays up to (approx. 720p or 1080i). High Speed cables support higher-resolution display (e.g. 1080p). They can deliver all video content currently defined for the HDMI standard (i.e. more than two 1080p/60 video streams, including 3D). HDMI cables with Ethernet are capable of sending 100/mbps over the HDMI Ethernet Channel. Since it is not likely that many HDMI 1.4 'standard' cables will be made or sold, I suspect that the crippled 'standard' type exists only to allow for calling the cables that support 1080p 'high speed' which sounds good and high-end.-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;",How is the product?,"[""WHO NEEDS IT?This wire should work well with anything that supports HDMI 1.3x but it's built to comply with the higher HDMI 1.4 standard""]",[0],[1],[0.25],[False]

You can carry around in your hand a whole library of large or small books and read them at your leisure, which can be just about anywhere. I think that aspect of it is great.There are also all kinds of games for it. I like a handful of the basic time-wasters, but otherwise I stay away from them.It does not have the basic card reader. It is designed with the idea that all of your storage will be on Amazon's Cloud Storage. Amazon gives you unlimited storage for the materials which you purchase from them, plus 5 GB for personal data. You can't transfer images from your favorite camera onto it, unless it has built-in WiFi (maybe). The Kindle is designed to rely only on it's built-in camera. I don't consider the built-in camera to be real great. Plus I consider the built-in camera awkward to use. It seems like the main idea of it is to take pictures of the user. Use with video calls and video conferencing would be ideal for it.Unlike the Netbooks, which were popular a couple of years ago, this tablet does not replace a computer in any sense of the word. You will still need a computer in addition to this tablet.Also, while I am on computer issues, Amazon's instructions say that this table will connect to any computer. This idea does not seem to be true with some computers and operating systems. My computer would be an example. The Kindle transfer system relies on the newest version of the Windows Media Player. I am running Windows 7-64 Premium on a 1 year old Toshiba. It has an AMD 64 bit processor and the 64 bit version of Windows 7. (Amazon and Microsoft both indicate that I am a minority with this choice.) I have the Windows Media Player on my computer. However, Microsoft gives me the message that the newest version of their Media Player will NOT run on my system. Apparently, my version of Windows Media Player is upgraded as far as Microsoft is going to upgrade it. (I never use it anyway.) It also appears that Kindle can not transfer files to my computer without the newest version. To get files from one computer to the other, it seems that I will have to email them to myself. (This is going to be a pain.)WiFi connections are problematic. That said, the Kindle version seems to be more problematic then most. I travel all over the USA. If you are in an area where there is a lot of WiFi routers, then the Kindle seems to get confused and refuses to work. Or you start running into security issues with everyone.I mentioned before that I am a movie buff. There is not room on it's internal storage to download a bunch of movies to it, and there is no external storage except on Amazon. I have even tried attaching an adapter and card reader card to it. This idea didn't work. Kindle won't recognize the card.I purchased a Bluetooth keyboard which works fine with it. But while I can pair up my computer to the Kindle with a Bluetooth connection, I still can not transfer files to/from my computer to the Kindle using it. (Don't know why, yet.)One thing that I have noticed is that this is a great idea to increase Amazon's business. I have purchased several apps and books from Amazon for it. Books are usually a lot cheaper to buy for use on Kindle. Apps are usually very cheap. And it is really nice to have a whole library to read at any given point where I have extra time. The built-in reader which reads books back to you is another great feature. I like have it read to me while I sit back and relax. (I am reminded of teachers asking me in high school if I was reading with my eyes closed and my head laying on the books.)Another issue that I have run into is the Kindle headphone-speaker plug. I am working trying to find out what works and what doesn't work with it. I have one set of headphones which will work with it, and they sound great. But most headphones and speakers won't work with it. The receiver socket of the plug-in area is recessed, and only a plug with an indented collar will make a connection. Standard speakers and headphones for other devices don't seem to work with it since their connecting plugs don't slide inside the socket far enough.The sound from the Kindle is great. The video is great. It is easy to read. There is a ton of things that you could do with it.In short, the Kindle is a great idea. But it still needs work.Update: Sept 18, 2013I have ordered many things from Amazon using my Kindle Fire HD.But it hit me that not all of the items available from Amazon will show up on the Kindle when browsing and placing orders. An example would be a jacket that I just received. I am a big person, and need big clothes. I ordered the largest size of a jacket that I liked using my Kindle Fire HD. It barely fits me. I looked at the jacket that I ordered on my home computer and saw that Amazon offers the jacket the next 2 sizes larger, and in additional colors. The additional larger sizes and colors where not showing on my Kindle when I placed the order.As I said before, the Kindle fine for reading books, magazines, and for a person's personal entertainment. In fact, it is great for that. But it does not replace a computer.",Does the video and pictures extremely sharp?,[],[],[],[],[]

No doubt the L lens surpasses this one when you photograph test charts (how often do you do that?), and its weather sealing allows it to withstand thunderstorms better, but frankly speaking, if you're not a pro who pushes the envelope, who cares?If you have a crop camera, this lens lets you take advantage of the smaller sensor - you're not paying for (and lugging around) all that extra glass.

Plus you're more likely to bring it with you.Yes, at longer focal lengths you lose one f-stop compared to the L lens.

Mid range is clear and precise and not at all obscured by the lower and upper registers.  Highs are crisp and clear.When I put them on for the first time, the fit was comfortable.  They are very good at blocking outside sounds.  The first music I found on my IPod that I wanted to hear was Dvorak's 9th Symphony.  Wonderful.  Instruments were distinct and clear.  Horns sounded rich and full.  A little Springsteen and the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper confirmed that these phones will handle a broad range of musical styles.  Sgt. Pepper was the album that made an audiophile of me back in the 60's when it was released.  At that time, I had a cheap portable stereo with a tilt out turntable and fold out speakers.  I wore out Sgt Pepper on that thing, and then, a friend happened to have it playing on his parents' high end Marantz receiver and impressive speakers when I stopped by one day.  I heard things from that music on his system that I had never heard on my cheap stereo, and I was hooked.  These phones at less than  a hundred dollars give me everything I heard on that high end system all those years ago.

I suspect this could be the reason why this didn't work properly.As a product, my feelings are explained below.Pros:- Price is great; it costs only $35 compared to most set-top boxes which cost around $100- Form factor is very small; it is a HDMI dongle and you can put it in your HDTV's HDMI port although you need to power it from a USB source.- It can cast contents from Chrome web browser (laptop or desktop) but mobile chrome is not supported. You can cast YouTube, Netflix and Google Play contents from mobile devices.- It is not a screen mirroring device (like AirPlay of AppleTV); it uses cloud. i.e. you can stream a YouTube video from your mobile device and can switch off the device, the play on your TV won't stop. And, you can manage that video from your chrome browser.Cons:- Works only in USA at the moment and Google has a bad habit of keeping things in &#34;beta&#34; mode for very long time (e.g. Gmail).- Supports only 2GHz band of your WiFi. This is one of the significant limitations. A device made in the year 2013 has no support for 5GHz; are you kidding? We are talking about WiFi AC standard and this crap doesn't support part of Wireless-N (5GHz)!! This will have impact on 1080p video (sampled at 20+ mbps while shooting) streaming for sure.- Very limited app support at the moment; it only supports YouTube, Netflix and Google Play (music and video). heck! my TV has both YouTube and Netflix app built-in and my android phone has YouTube Remote App; another $35 on such a device is not worth (at least at this moment).- HD video streaming is not as smooth as expected. It has lags and I could see framing issue in the videos (looks like some of the frames reach with some delay) while casting a 1080p YouTube video from my HTC One to TV.- Heavy dependency on High speed internet (and yet it does not support 5GHz band!!)- You cannot play your local files (audio/video); heck! my android device can play those using a DLNA-UPnP app. And, most HDTVs come with DLNA feature, so this is not a compelling need from this device, but it would definitely a nice-to-have.

Getting Cat6 to the room in question was a bit of a pain so I had been putting it off.*I'd recommend Cat6 or better cabling and a router or switch with QoS features.*I'm limited on the features I'm acclimated to just yet so I'll update this review at a later date.Pros: Small footprint - inputs are great, including 2 USB 2.0 - the interface is easy to navigate and appealing to the eye - internet media selection is nice i.e. Netflix, Blockbuster, Pandora, Facebook, and so on - I got this gadget essentially to have a decent interface for Netflix that I could use with my universal remote. Honestly Wii has the best Netflix interface, but the one here is a close second, and since the Wii requires another remote, this is the winner. There is no ""search"" feature which the Wii interface has, but the built in categories are far superior and a bit comical to boot.Cons: It's a hundred bucks... The Netflix interface could have a search, but not a deal breaker. The unit is a little slow to boot.Thoughts: This is a nice little unit, pretty cheap all things considered, Windows like navigation.Update:I love this product! I've since purchased a few more. The interface issues I spoke of in my previous rating have been enhanced to include a search feature as well as more internet media options i.e. Hulu Pro etc. The one I would really like to see WD cut a deal with is Amazon. *Crosses fingers*You will likely have to do a couple of firmware updates, make sure you do them all, it really makes a difference.(They do take some time)I have had a couple of solid lock-ups, all you need to do is unplug the unit for a few seconds and plug it back in & you're off and running again. Don't take this wrong, it does not happen often and is definitely not a deal killer or anything; just nature of the beast. Just understand every now and then you need to re-boot it. Speaking of, an actual power button would be nice for this reason. (There is not one)So, highly recommend this product and Amazon had them on sale for $59.00 recently. *Presses Add-To-Cart*Happy Netflixing!",How is the audio?,[],[],[],[],[]

The recharger works just fine and the distance range is OK. Other than that, they are a total disappointment. The dynamic range seems very compressed around the vocal frequencies with the higher frequencies the most affected although the bass is also weak. Virtually none of my music sounds good.

I tried turning off but then it didn't turn back on.  Took it back and it was replaced with a brand new one!Now I've had it for a while and have 3 accounts setup, one for myself, one for the wife and one restricted account for my 5 yr old.  The wife mainly watches videos (YouTube), son plays games and I play and surf.  Response is great although our internet connection is at tops 6Mbs so there are times when something that needs internet access may lag a bit.  I noticed one app that I play on my HTC One S always complains about the connection when I use the HTC phone, but on this tablet it just runs smoothly without every complaining - odd since they use the same WiFi connection.  The tablet response is good.The Android OS on this tablet is simple compared to my phone which has the HTC Sense version - not that the phone is ""hard"", but it may be why the phone seems a lot less responsive than this tablet.If you used any of the other OS (iOS, Win8, Firefox, etc...) then you will find the controls somewhat familiar.  Although there will be differences, they won't keep you from using the tablet.  You still have the apps you can download - some are free and some are paid apps.The volume control issue on the initial tablet seems to happen a bit as this one did the same, but I found out I could just change user accounts and it will work again - odd, but hopefully there will be an update that will prevent that from happening at all.Overall I am happy with the purchase and although there are a few things I wish it had (like expandable memory slot for a SD card for one, HDMI output for another), I think it's a great, fast and nice size for our first tablet.Update: Still have issue with ""mute"" getting stuck and having to swap accounts to get audio volume to function again.  But now also have an issue where the notification pull down bar (or whatever you want to call it) appears as we try to launch apps, swipe, or do anything.  We are having to power off and back on before it will work again.  Whatever they did with the latest release appears to have made the tablet worst than better and I've adjusted my rating accordingly.Update2: With the install of 4.4 KitKat, the screen problems appear to be gone now.  I haven't been using Mute a lot lately so not sure if that issue is also gone.Update3: And the problem is back!  Put a video on YouTube title Ematic vs Nexus 7.  The Ematic is a quad-core for $80 and in my opinion a better buy since it works (at least for now).  I'm going to see if Asus will take their paper weight back and give a refund.  This would be great if it worked correctly.Update4: Tablet's been with Asus for over two weeks.  RMA says waiting for customer confirmation ""swap"" so I called to find out what that meant and was told I will receive an email when Asus decides what to offer me.  Not a good experience at all.  You take a chance with these tablets that they will not work and you'll be stuck paying to send them back to Asus and wait for them to decide ""what to offer you"".Update4.1: May 30th received the replacement.  Asus sent a notice saying they shipped it and to check the ""courier"" site for updates but only listed ""TRUCKING"" as the courier with no tracking info.  On May 29th Fed Ex left a message saying they will be delivering a package that required a signature - that would have been hard to arrange if we were in a situation where no one would be home.  The item shipped from CA and not TX so I figured it must be a replacement unit and I was right as the serial # is different.

I describe how I relate to the SRH440 (i.e. my personal tastes and how I use the headphone) only after covering all of the objective issues.Summary of sound: It's no coincidence that the SRH440 has such a good soundstage and sense of openness, since those properties are highly dependent on a neutral frequency response that's free of peaks, recesses, and colorations which derive mainly from undamped resonances.My first impression of the SRH440 is neutral sound. But it's much better than that. In my 80-odd headphone reviews, I've used expressions like &#34;fairly neutral&#34; or &#34;basically neutral&#34; etc., but the number of those that I'd play with no EQ whatever were very few: B&W; P7, Beyerdynamic Custom One Pro, FAD Pandora VI, Mad Dog, Sennheiser IE800, and the Shure SRH1840. Compared to those six, the SRH440 gets close to the Mad Dog and the IE800, and has a better signature I think than the other four. In the case of the P7 and Pandora VI, their responses are slightly more 'V'-shaped, but still fine for most genres as is. The Custom One Pro and the SRH1840 are a bit more bland, but also fine for most music genres. The SRH440's (understandable) limitation is its ultimate resolution - the most expensive headphones I've listed here have a subtly clearer sound that's noticeable in direct comparisons, but when the SRH440 is heard on its own, I doubt that very many users would hear the sound as any less than perfect.Some concerns I have with low-cost headphones are inconsistencies in matching the sound between the left and right drivers, and matching the sound between different production samples of the same headphone. When there are any such inconsistencies, a customer may experience a very different sound than what they were expecting based on reviews they've read. Although the SRH440 is only $99 USD currently, every indication I have is for a high quality well-made product. The limitations I notice most compared to the more expensive headphones are the fit and finish - the finish is plain and plastic, but elegant in its simplicity. The earcup fit doesn't feel as though it's making a good seal to my head, which is usually critical for proper bass response, but since the bass is just right anyway, the only issue with the fit is that it's not as luxurious as with the pricier headphones. The SRH440 earpads are quite good, and are a huge step up in quality from (for example) the Sennheiser HD280 Pro earpads.Earcup rotation is no more than a few degrees horizontally. Vertical rotation is 180 degrees, so from the earcup rotations I'd expect the SRH440 to fit a wide range of head sizes. My average-size head fits with the earcups pulled out to click stop no. 4, allowing a 3/4 inch smaller and 5/4 inch larger adjustment to the headband on each side. The long coiled cable is single-entry to the left earcup, and has a proprietary detachable locking connector with a 2.5 mm stereo plug (same as other Shure headphones). The cable is terminated with a standard 3.5 mm miniplug threaded for a 6.35 mm plug adapter (included). A soft plastic carry bag is also included.The comments in the music tracks listed in this review can be compared to other headphone reviews I've done, to get an idea of how the SRH440 plays the different music tracks listed here compared to other headphones. My suggestion is instead of reading each comment below as an absolute unto itself, you could compare these notes to other reviews as they get posted, and see how the SRH440 compares with each individual track.Animotion - Obsession (1980's New Wave/Techno): The upper bass synth has excellent detail and tone with a modest weight, and both male and female vocals sound natural without favoring either. The SRH440 plays this extremely well.Bauhaus - Bela Lugosi's Dead (~1980): Strong midrange sound effects - this is a good worst-case test for resonant-type sounds in the most sensitive midrange area. Handled perfectly by the SRH440.Beethoven Symphony 9, Solti/CSO (1972): Excellent overall sound. Of special note here are the bass impacts beginning around 10:30 of the fourth movement. Those impacts are soft and well in the background, but you can feel some of the weight they carry with the SRH440.Black Sabbath - Iron Man (Classic Rock): Very good instrumental detail and the vocal sounds very natural. As with most classic rock tracks, there is very little or no deep bass. The SRH440 plays this music smoothly, and the lack of deep bass doesn't unbalance the treble.Boz Scaggs - Lowdown (1976): Good sound quality - this is a great test for any nasality in the midrange. Handled extremely well by the SRH440.Cantus - Danny Boy (Traditional/Male Choral/Acapella): The SRH440 plays the voices with enough low end warmth and weight to sound very natural, yet there is no added emphasis of the lower register of the male voices on this track.Cath Carroll - Moves Like You (1980's New Wave/Techno): This track's percussion and voice are crisp and well-balanced, and there's a good sense of space or soundstage around the voices and instruments. The SRH440 reproduces the space and detail convincingly.Catherine Wheel - Black Metallic (~1991): Goth with industrial overtones - I like this since it's a great music composition and the sound effects are smoothly integrated into the mix. This may sound distorted or mushy with some headphones, but the SRH440 renders the deliberate instrumental distortions clearly.Chris Isaak - Wicked Game (Pop/Rock): The SRH440 plays this high treble energy recording very smoothly - the voice and instruments are detailed but not sharp or edgy.Chromatics - I'm On Fire (Synth-Pop, female lead): This track has a good amount of space around the voice and instruments, making for a very pleasant stereo image. The voice is excellent and the tambourine sound has better than average tonality.David Hazeltine - Fur Elise (Jazz): A very high-quality recording from HDTracks. The SRH440 reproduces the instruments smoothly with a spacious ambiance. The wire-brush-on-cymbal harmonics are very extended and detailed.Grieg (Beecham-Royal Philharmonic) - Peer Gynt-Solveig's Lullaby (Classical): This very old (late 1950's) stereo recording must have been made on the most expensive gear in the world, since the overall sound quality and especially Ilse Hollweg's amazing voice are as close to &#34;being there&#34; as I've heard with some of the better classical recordings made since the year 2000. The SRH440 plays this music perfectly.Hans Zimmer - Dark Knight-Aggressive Expansion (Soundtrack): The percussion in this track hits really hard, and the bass tones beginning around 0:45 have the ultra-deep &#34;shuddery&#34; kind of sound and feel that indicates a good deep-bass response. Overall, the SRH440 plays this music very well.Heaven 17 - Let Me Go (1980's New Wave/Techno): The bass instrument (guitar?) has very good detail, and the voices and ambiance have a &#34;you are there&#34; quality that's uncommon in early 1980's pop music. The SRH440 plays this track perfectly.Hugo Audiophile - 15-16 (Electronic): I'm not sure what the 15-16 stands for - perhaps track numbers from a CD album. The deep-bass tones that start around 33-34 seconds into the track reproduce extremely well with the SRH440. This is a great recording for evaluating whether a headphone's bass will be sufficient for most environments, since for many headphones that have a weaker bass, the deep bass gets absorbed and mostly lost when the environment contains a lot of low-frequency energy.Human League - Keep Feeling Fascination (1980's New Wave/Techno): This track's bass line is very detailed, but the somewhat forward voices don't have quite the &#34;you are there&#34; quality of the Heaven 17 track noted above.Jimmy Smith - Basin Street Blues (early 60's): This track has several loud crescendos of brass and other instruments that don't sound clean and musical with some headphones. The SRH440 provides excellent detail. Listen particularly to the second crescendo at 15 seconds in for maximum detail effect. I'd like to emphasize that these crescendos are probably the worst-case test I have for instrument separation and detail, and the SRH440 does those exceptionally well.Kellogg Auditorium, Battle Creek Michigan, Aeolian-Skinner Organ (1933) - Pedal, 32', Resultant, Arpeggio: This 16 hz organ pedal tone differs from other music tones in that you won't &#34;hear&#34; the tone - you'll only feel it. Although most music tones have harmonics (including this one), the harmonics from this tone will be too weak to provide any &#34;feel&#34;, so whatever you actually hear would not be part of the fundamental 16 hz tone. There are ~30 hz sounds in the outdoor environment in big cities, generated by large trucks, buses, and subway trains, and they have a quality of &#34;rumble&#34; that's similar to some deep-bass tones found in music. This 16 hz organ tone is easily distinguished from those sounds when compared on a headphone that has good undistorted response at 16 hz. The SRH440 plays this very well.Mantovani - Sunrise Sunset (Easy Listening, ca. 1972): A master musician and conductor who specialized in light classics and orchestral pop music, Mantovani's accomplishments were overshadowed by music critics who couldn't tolerate the notion of &#34;light classics&#34; or &#34;semi-classical&#34; music, even when those recordings were no threat to the classical music genres. In any case the later Mantovani recordings from the mid-1960's through mid-1970's had the advantage of being mixed for much better hi-fi systems than those which the music critics possessed at the start of the Long Playing (LP) record cycle. Here in 2014, at least some of those digital remasters have improved the sound further, although it's not always the case. This track as played on the SRH440 is an excellent example of the sheer musicality lurking in those later recordings, and is highly recommended for soundstage, instrumental tone, and musical balance.Michael Tilson Thomas - Rhapsody In Blue (20th Century Classic): Great sound and soundstage, and terrific piano playing and tone. There are some very deep bass impacts starting around 38 seconds into the 17:24 length track, and the weight of those impacts is subtle but appreciable with the SRH440.Porcupine Tree - Trains (Pop-Rock): This track opens with some nicely-detailed string sounds and a forward-sounding male voice with a higher-than-average register. There are a series of &#34;clip-clop&#34; effects starting at 3:19 that should sound like they were made with wooden blocks of some kind. The SRH440 reproduces those sounds very well.Richard Strauss (Mester-Pasadena) - Also Sprach Zarathustra (opening) (Classical): The granddaddy of bass is in the opening 1:50 of this recording, and I've heard it only once on a large and expensive loudspeaker system in Cleveland. For most people, that experience would be indistinguishable from being in a fairly strong earthquake. The SRH440 conveys as much of that experience as is possible on a more-or-less neutral headphone. The tympani also have good impact here.Scarlatti-Kipnis - Sonata in E Major K381 (Classical, Harpsichord): The harpsichord here is fairly bright and highly detailed, and the SRH440 renders the tones and transients very well.Trombone Shorty - Backatown (Jazz-Funk): The deep bass impacts here are quite strong, and work very well with the horns and other instruments. The SRH440 delivers the impacts with proper weight and detail, and the horns have the kind of bite that gives them a wonderfully realistic sound.William Orbit - Optical Illusion (Billy Buttons Mix) (Electronic): This is about as close as I want to get to easy-listening music. The string tones beginning at 0:18 are fairly soft, and while the bass isn't very deep, it still adds a good underpinning to the music. The short poetic rap at 4:14, preceded by an etherial female voice, works very well with this track.",How is the detail?,['provides excellent detail'],[8351],[1],[1.],[ True]

Don't know what to say about that except, buy more than 1 and preferably from different vendors. I think charging $20-$40 is criminal, but I would pay $10 for a known to be decent cable.  I think eForcity would eventually make it right, but a person would be more likely to think it's the hardware malfunctioning since the cable still works to some degree. That's what the 1.3b rating is about. Unfortunately there are no easy ways to tell if a cable is good other than to swap it out unless you have the proper measuring and testing equipment.Update 07/06/09--eForcity must be complimented for their customer service.  I received two replacement cables shortly after notifying them.They worked but I stuck with the original cable I had bought from them a year ago. As I stated before, apparently a cable can work for awhile and then fail partially due to the high data transfer rates. The replacement cables are working okay on another less sophisticated system.Great pricing, but you take a chance here. Also, the ad states HDMI 1.3b specs, but the packaging only says 1.3, which is not the same spec!I would upgrade eForcity's star rating just based on their customer service and the original cable I have from them but it can't be changed at this point.",How is the quality of the image?,[],[],[],[],[]

I got it home and started playing with it.Sure, it's a decent camera, but it was obvious that I would eventually want to upgrade to an DSLR.All things considered, there are a couple of ways to think about this camera:One is that it is a relative bargain for what it offers. High resolution, relatively fast shooting speed (compared to other point and shoot cameras), high quality video capability (amazingly good), image stabilized lens (low light shots were still blurry), 12X zoom, macro capability in an all-in-one package. You don't really need any addons except for more memory and a case.The other side is that it is expensive. $450-500 is expensive for anything, and this camera is no exception.For me, I believed the latter. Since I was spending $500, why not  spend a few hundred more (ok 500 more) and just get the Digital Rebel XT?Anyway, after battling the 2 sides for a day or so, I returned the camera and bought the digital rebel XT. My advice is to definitely go for the DSLR, they are in different leagues.The S2 performed poorly in low light. It has an overly complex menu system. The DSLR has more buttons. I like buttons. They are much more accessible than a nested menu system.The S2 was slow, offering 1.5 fps (max) while my DSLR has 3 fps. I found the wait to take my next shot with the S2 agonizingly slow, with the flash much longer.Strangely, the S2 has a lens cap that just won't stay on. Perhaps one of the weakest aspects of the camera. I was holding the camera still, and the cap just slid off to the floor. Be prepared to lose the cap eventually.The S2 has a cheap plastic silver look to it. It looks like the ""flavor of the month"". I'm not sure why so many electronics are plastic silver. Guess it's the trend. I'd much rather have black. I believe the S2 is as heavy as or even heavier than the Digital Rebel XT.Bottom line is the camera may be one of the best sub-DSLR camera out there but it doesn't come close to the DSLR .

The Sony MDRV6 excells as the best value of any headphone that I've ever owned.  They are especially good at producing natural-sounding deep bass, and the overall octave-to-octave balance is excellent.  The sound quality is all in all comparable to other headphones that cost considerably more.The MDRV6 is especially well-suited for travel due to the collapsible design, and for noisy environments or for quiet environments such as a library where the sound emitted by open-back headphones would distract others.The MDRV6 is not quite as comfortable as some other headphones, but the comfort can be improved enormously by replacing the pads with the velour pads from BeyerDynamic.  The pads that come on the MDRV6 have a non-breathable cover, and significant additional discomfort is caused by the way that the thin foam cover is glued to the pad around the inner circumference of the pad, which prevents the top and back of your ear from slipping into the space between the pad and the face of the headphone.  This forces the pad to rest on the back of the ear, which compresses the ear and eventually becomes uncomfortable.  I read on a web forum where several people had replaced the pads (which eventually come apart) with a velour pad made by BeyerDynamic, and after I did this replacement on my one pair that had a damaged pad, the increase in comfort was so great that I immediately did the other pair.  The thin cover can be glued down to the headphone face if needed to hold it in place, which then allows the top and rear of your ear to naturally  slide under the inner circumference of the pad, which is considerably more comfortable.  I can recommend this trivial modification without reservation to anyone who owns these headphones.  Even if you don't replace the pads with the BeyerDynamic velour pads, I suggest removing the pads anyway, then carefully separating the thin cover from the pad, and glueing the cover directly to the headphone surface.",What is the tonal balance of these headphones?,['I have been a headphone fanatic for thirty years'],[0],[1],[0.8],[ True]

It also has a handle to support it with one hand.Having used the product for over a month I am very happy with it. All the buttons are accessible through the cutouts. One thing to do is make sure the flap that holds the ipad in on the edge with the full slot is velcroed tightly so it can't slip at all. The stand works well - I even just use the ipad in bed, sitting it right on my chest. The magnet system to sleep/wake the unit when the cover is opened or closed works perfectly. My only concern is that I see a slight tear at one of the hinges.  I don't think it will develop into a problem, so I give it 5 stars - obviously if it does not last my opinion will change. (The product doesn't seem to have any additional warranty.)Some buyers mentioned an odor issue when they first unpacked it. I did not have that problem.Since the ipad and case are black, and the ipad works in any orientation it can take a bit of feeling to find the on-off button...I may stick a little colored sticker to make it obvious.

It was 1982 when the company decided that because no one had come up with a good way to use their Multi-Tool Word (later Microsoft Word) for MS-DOS and for Xenix, so in 1983, Microsoft created and shipped their first PC-compatible mouse, which was the beginning of Microsoft Hardware. Unlike most MS-DOS programs at the time, Word was designed to be used with a mouse, and putting it simply, it was a clunky device with a weighted ball mouse inside, and had a cord that plugged into the serial port of the PC. But for this user, it was an amazing device that made word processing far easier.In 1984, PC Magazine columnist John C. Dvorak stated the mouse as a reason the Macintosh would fail. That obviously didn't happen, and the rest is history.I bought thisMicrosoft Wireless Mobile Mouse 3500 for Businessas a result of having two from another manufacturer that were having problems with the rubberized sides peeling off, and because the small 'glide pads' on the bottom had peeled off after using them for a few years. Had bought aLogitech Wireless Mouse M505for my MacBook Pro earlier this year as a replacement, and this new one from Microsoft was destined for use with my Windows 7 PC. Sometimes it's good to have products for comparison.Likes:+ Blue Track Technology; offers excellent tracking, very smooth+ Rubberized sides; provide a very comfortable grip+ On/Off switch; located on the base, saves battery life+ Excellent ergonomics; fits the hand quite nicely+ Behaves well with both Windows 7 and Mac OS X 10.8.x+ Nano Transceiver; stores easily in base when being transported+ Scroll wheel has good sensitivity; smooth and stable+ Runs from one AA battery; included; Microsoft claims up to 8 months life+ Ambidextrous; works well with right or left hand operation+ Good packaging; comes in a cardboard box that's easy to openDislikes:- None so farOverview:I was curious how thisMicrosoft Wireless Mobile Mouse 3500 for Businessmight be different from theMicrosoft Wireless Mobile Mouse 3500 - Loch Ness Gray. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it all seems to be in the packaging. The one marked ""3500 for Business"" comes in an easy-to-open recyclable brown cardboard box, which is a plus point for this user... no clamshell packaging to deal with.This mouse is smooth and easy to set up... it's simple plug & play with either the PC or the Mac, and I've tested it with both. It's responsive, and though the scroll wheel has a slight ""bumpier"" feel than the Logitech M505, it's adjustments are easy to adjust within the Windows Control Panel. The Logitech has a greater life with batteries, but that's because it uses two AA batteries as opposed to one AA cell with the Microsoft product, so that's a wash.As far as sensitivity and accuracy go, both of these models appear to be about equal, and both can be customized to fit your needs from within the software settings. The Logitech M505 is slightly longer, and the Microsoft is almost identical in size and shape to a Logitech M305; both fit the hand quite well and have an excellent ergonomic feel. Only time will tell if the rubberized sides and feet will stay on longer than those on the Logitech M305. Looking back across the history of the various Microsoft (and other) mouse units that I've had over the years back to the days of those with wired interfaces, it's amazing how much the technology has progressed over the years.TheMicrosoft Wireless Mobile Mouse 3500 for Businessfeels and works like a good, solid product, yet it would be hard for this user to recommend it above the Logitech M505. Though slightly different in size and shape, both have an excellent ergonomic feel. The Microsoft 3500 with its Loch Ness Gray finish does have a good, businesslike appearance as opposed to looking like a work of art, so if that matters to you, then it's a good choice.11/23/2012",How was the quality?,[],[],[],[],[]

To some who have made listening to music a part of their lives for the better part of their lives, it usually does not take long at all for one truth to become glaringly and disturbingly apparent: no longer could the music speak for itself. The mandates of the compression algorithms now dictate what we hear.I don't want to raise the spectre of arguments like this long passed- the cassette tape, the CD- for that matter, people were probably bitching about the change from shellac to vinyl.But one fact remains unalterable: MP3's mess with the music. And using them in evaluating any sound reproduction device, i.e. speakers, headphones, earbuds, strikes me as not dissimilar from using Applebee's food to evaluate cutlery.This is by no means intended to be a slam at Applebees, but the point for which I strive is how can you tell if you are dining on the best when what you are eating is a faulty reproduction of the real thing?Having cleared the air with that, I can move on to say that MP3's have forced even the most casual but dedicated music appreciator into the same niche as the true audiophile- suddenly, it makes a difference.So then how to judge and review? Where is the benchmark? I would split with a broadaxe the subject into two categories: did it come with a 1/8"" mini-plug, or a true "" audio connector?As these cans came with the former, we must assume that they were primarily intended for the MP3 and portable music crowd in general. The slick foldability of the design furthers this theory. The aforementioned plug is of a slim design, clearly intended to fit into any device with any shell.It is also angled at a 45, the first time I have seen this and at once settling the argument of straight up or 90.That they are Bose insures two things: the sound quality promises that they will be superior, and that they are probably overpriced.In back to back tests with a particular favorite album using my new benchmark Sennheiser cans, the Bose did OK- I noticed they seem to deliver more volume at a lower setting from the playback device, in this case an iPod Classic.While the sound was clear and relatively distinct, I would say that's about it. The bass response was adequate, nothing special. After the truly sensual experience of the over the ear Sennheisers, going back to an on-ear device such as this is a letdown.But there can be no argument that the quality is superb, the ""knockdown"" and storage of these phones is very nicely executed,although it does seem that they would not take well to rough handling. So, unlike others I have seen, they come with a semi-rigid case that's roughly (and ironically) the size of a CD, and well built to stand the rigors of travel. To test this theory I may pass them along to my flight attendant sister for the analysis of a true road- or sky warrior.All in all, there are too many choices, and yours will probably be determined in part by reviews such as this, what your friends say, and ultimately what brand you choose to advertise on your head. You can do worse than the Bose for the same price, but I believe with more diligent study you might also do better.",How was your ear?,['you might also do better' '-ear device such'],[3250 2448],[1 1],[0.5 0.5],[False False]

The light has been fixed by a piece of electrical tape over the button (which does make the button a bit harder to use, but it's not bad) and the second issue is fixed by merely putting a larger tip on the ear bud.

Resolution is expected to be bumped up to 1920 x 1080, new Qualcomm Snapdragon processor for increased speed, 2 gigs of RAM, a back camera, and for the cellular plan, LTE. Pricing rumors haven't been released. So, if you can wait a few months, it's probably best to see what Google has in store for the Nexus 7 Second Edition before buying the currently offered Nexus 7.End of Update.Full Disclosure:I own an iPad 3 and an iTouch and a four, going on five year old Motorola dumb phone.I'm not going deep into hardware specs, you can read other reviews for that.[EDIT FOR NEWEST GOOGLE PRESS RELEASE]On October 29th, Google released the updated Nexus 7. The ONLY things that changed was that the 8gb version was discontinued, the 16gb version dropped to $199 and the 32gb version was released for $249 (both available for purchase NOW). The 3G cellular version is on sale starting November 13, 2012. Do not buy the existing Nexus 7 versions at current prices posted on Amazon! You're paying way too much.[/END EDIT]Let's address some of the perceived flaws and some of the real flaws of the Nexus 7.1) Storage. 8gb and  16gb (the two flavors the Nexus 7 comes in) can go real fast real quick in today's age of HD movies. I took my 16gb iPad on a trip and I maxed out with movies incredibly fast, even after I shrunk them down to least tolerable quality. The Nexus 7 does deserve some criticism for no Micro-SD slot and I was not going to buy it for that sole reason. However, like all good Android Tablets, there's a solution.[SUPER BIG EDIT FOR HIGHLY IMPORTANT INFORMATION]:It's called USB On The Go. Essentially you take a USB OTG cable (like $1 on Ebay), plug it into your Nexus 7, download the Nexus Media Importer app (Currently $3 on Google Play) and then connect whatever side hard drive or flash drive you want. The largest size external media I could connect to (and have access too) is a 3TB Western Digital. So much for 8/16 gig limits! The only problem I encountered with large drives is that the Media Importer app (which streams media as well as allowing one way coping to the Nexus 7) is that it crashes when you try to stream media out of folders that contain huge amounts of files, like 3,000 mp3s. If you're cheap, you can do much of the same via Stickmount and a file manager (Stickmount requires rooting). But the Nexus Media Importer just makes it ridiculously easy. Best $3 in credit I spent.With OTG and flash drives you don't need the cloud. Ever. Seriously, whoever decided to not put in the MicroSD to force cloud should be fired at Google.Oh yeah. And this requires absolutely ZERO rooting. Take your Nexus out of the box. Download the Nexus Media Importer App. Buy the cable. Plug in your thumb drive. You're good to go.As of today (10/5/12), I was able to connect a canon point and shoot, iPad 3, iTouch, 4 small flash drives (less than 2 GB), a 1 TB and 3 TB external hard drives (Western Digital), a SD card reader (with regular and microSD via adapter) and was able to pull/stream files off all of them (FAT and NFTS formatting, no EXFAT at the moment sorry!). For some reason my old Motorola ZN5 (ancient eh?) no longer registers anymore, but as long as you plug in relatively new devices you'll be okay. An exception is I plugged in my 9 year old iRiver player and it streamed music perfectly.Don't forget that OTG also lets you plug in and use keyboards (wired and wireless via dongle) and mice without rooting. Mice generate a cursor when plugged in. Also be aware that OTG may charge devices from your Nexus 7. For you true gamers, PS/3 controllers work as well. Not on all games, but games like Dead Trigger they'll work just like they do on a PS/3. Like to see that on a Kindle Fire or an iPad!2) Display. Yes, it's not an iPad. It's also less than half the price of the new iPad. Text is still crisp and clean and colors are largely well done. Not iPad well done, but save yourself $300 well done. It's fairly responsive, not iPad response, but better than many other tablets out there. I have no complaints about it. As for the screen separation, that seems to be more of an issue with the 16gb version than the 8gb. I haven't had any ghosting issues either.3) Camera is pretty terrible. The front facing 1.2 megapixel is nothing to get excited about. And there is no back camera. I honestly don't get why that's just a big deal. You look like a tool using the back camera. Anyone does. Even Olivia Wilde (13 on a total possible score of 10 house fans!) would look like a douche using a tablet's back camera to take video/pictures. Odds are you have your smartphone with a decent camera. Use that. There oddly though, is no app for the camera that ships with the Nexus 7. But there is a free Nexus 7 camera launcher app.4) Apps. True, the Apple ecosystems has far more apps designed for tablets than Android does. But most of your apps, like skype, facebook, office utilities are all there. Furthermore, rather than being stuck on iTunes you can install Amazon's app store in addition to the preloaded Google Play store.5) No cellular connection. Fair enough, but it does have the capacity to get on to a hotspot. Meaning, just tether your smart phone. Granted, that costs money, but the fact that something like 80% of all tablets sold, Android and Apple are wifi only suggests that cellular connections on tablets is highly overrated. If you're one of those 8 out of 10 people who don't care about cell connections on your tablet, this shouldn't obviously matter.[EDIT]: The 3G cellular model available now on Google Play sells for $300. Also, does not support CDMA networks so no Verizon or Sprint. Ships with an AT&T; sim card.[/Edit]6) No Flash - This is technically half wrong. While Jelly Bean does not support Flash off the bat, there are FREE fixes to get flash on to your Nexus.Google ""Install Flash On Nexus 7""The downside is you need a browser that is flash coded which includes Firefox Beta (free on Google play). It's a bit convoluted but follow the instructions and you'll have your flash games. I've posted pictures on the Nexus 7 8GB image gallery of both flash games AND streaming flash video off my Nexus 7.If an iPad user like me can figure this out, you can too!Now on to other things:Little black rectangle is lightning fast. The five core processor (yes, there are five I'll get to that later) loads things speedy without crashes and without bugs. My iPad crashes apps pretty regularly. Only once has my settings crashed but that was largely due to me screwing up my setup of my Wi-Fi extender. I can't fault the Nexus 7 for that. Speaking of which, the Nexus was super useful walking all over my house and yard to diagnosis network deadzones and other problems. 3/4 of a pound and strong Wi-Fi pick up made that job real easy, especially with free Wi-Fi apps. I could have done that with my iPad, but that would have been far less fun. Also, the Nexus 7 picks up Wi-Fi networks my iPad doesn't.Jelly Bean isn't as smooth as iOS 5/6 but it is better than every other Android device that my friends and family have used (and I played around with).Oh yes, five cores. The process actually has a fifth core that keeps basic services running when the device is in sleep mode. That saves massive amounts of energy. The battery life on the Nexus is better than my iPad without comparison even when doing the same things. The fifth core doesn't operate during normal operations. Battery life on this device is phenomenal.EDIT: On light usage, I am able to get ~195 hours before hitting 5% battery. On medium, movie watching no heavy gaming, I can regularly do ~110 hours before hitting 5%. GPS however, will eat power like nobody's business.What I like about the Nexus 7 is that I can largely customize anything I want. The Nexus ships with a format that is more phone than tablet, but with a Root and a few apps, I was able to switch it to the Tablet UI that you see in 10"" Android tablets. I personally prefer that format but it makes icons smaller to fit it all in. Not the best for older people. But that's the great thing about Android in general. Whatever you want to change, you probably can. And the Nexus 7 is no different.Google Voice Search is pretty awesome. It's not as good as Siri in actually reading back answers to you, most of my searches lead to a web search with links. Weather does get repeated in a Siri like female voice. Speak slowly and clearly. Or you'll get weird results. Also, phrase questions more as searches than something you'd ask a real human. Google Voice does not do well with questions like ""do I need an umbrella today?"" Ask ""Weather forecast (your location).""Now, in my opinion, one of the coolest things about the Nexus 7 is in the built in GPS coupled with the free cached maps. Say you're going to visit your friend who's getting married in small town in Iowa. You can either buy a GPS or bring your Nexus 7 with the map of the small town saved to memory. Turn on the GPS and it will track where you on in the town on the map real time no wifi/cell connection required. I downloaded a map of my town and tracked myself going to work. Planning your route out can easily turn the Nexus 7 into a GPS system without any additional costs.EDIT: Note, this doesn't give you turn by turn directions by itself. To get turn by turn directions you need the ""NAvFree USA"" (there is a Navfree for other countries) app off the Google Play store. It's free. Download your state and set your destination. It gives out voice commands on when to turn similar to a dedicated GPS device. It doesn't name street names which is expected considering it's free, but it is largely accurate saying ""in 100 meters, turn right."" My recent test of the app did ask me to drive over a divided highway though. As long as you pay attention though, this app coupled with the Nexus 7 will function as decent GPS offline, no wifi, no cell connection. And it even recalculates the route if you miss a turn.Speaker is pretty terrible compared to iPad. But the audio on headphones is on par. I don't expect anyone to really use the speaker so I'm not counting that as a real disadvantage.One thing: if you are a student planning on using this for notes, don't. The screen is way too small to actually take notes well and you need a blue tooth keyboard as well. Virtual on screen keyboard already eats up too much space. However, there is a speech to text and it might work well recording what your professor says. That said, you're better off with either the iPad or the Asus Transformer w/ keyboard. Or a real laptop.All in all I do like the tablet and often I'll reach for it over the iPad. Except when it comes to shopping online and browsing (and Facebook). The 7"" is simply too small to offer real competition to a 9~10"" screen. The use of keyboard via OTG alleviates this a bit but the screen is still really small.If you're looking to jump into Android, this is the tablet to do so. Plus if you buy now you get $25 in Google Play credit and a transformers movie copy. Not the biggest of Michael Bay but $25 brings the actual cost quite down.Word of caution: the 16 GB versions seem to be affected by a poor manufacturing/QC issues. The 8 GB versions seem to have far fewer problems. If you're okay with OTG external storage, go with the 8 GB version as you're likely to have far less chance of getting a defective unit.One more annoying fact: If you root your device and get a custom recovery, you can't install over the air updates. Found this out the hard way. You have to manually install Android updates.",What text do you prefer?,['Text is still crisp and clean and colors are largely well done'],[3919],[3],[0.5150794],[ True]

It didn't set up very fast and took a number of tries to get the macros right for turning on the TV and switching input devices, but once it was set it's been great.  My kids are 12 and 15 and are thankful for the remote.  They don't have to ask for my help to play video games or watch a DVD anymore.A few particular features I like about the remote:1. The keys for the most part are backlit and when you move the remote the display and backlight are activated, you don't have to push a button.2. It is rechargable.  I hate having to replace batteries every few months.  It lasts almost a week on one charge... but I put it on the charger after about 3 or 4 days.  I don't want to chance being without this baby.3. It will learn commands from my other remotes.  This was very helpful when setting up the macro for switching TV inputs.  Even tho I put the TV make and model in it didn't know how to switch from SAT input to DVD input without a little learning.  This all depends on your TV.  Mine is a Mitsubishi WD-65733.  I also had to tell it what the inputs were called and which ones were listed in what order.  Beware... I think it was case sensitive in setup.4.  If you want to go into the advanced features of one of your devices without using the macros to do what you want to do you can still do that.  Just a double click of a button and you can set the surround sound on your stereo receiver or modify the night display on your DVD player... and so on.5.  It controlls my HD DVR from DirectTV so I can still FWD,RWD, pause, and record without any problems.  It does everything the remote for the device did.6.  You can upload your own photos to the remote and set them as the background in the display.What I don't like???There are really only two things I would change about it and that's the feel of the buttons and the ease of setup.  Some buttons are very small and they're hard plastic.  Some remotes have the nice big rubber buttons and for some people they really like those.  I don't know how you could make it easier but I did have to get it to learn a few commands from my TV remote.  Some people just aren't into computers and electronics much and could get frustrated by this.Over all, this is one sweet remote.  My friends are jealous when they come over.  A co-worker went out and had to buy the same one because he liked it so much.  I highly recommend it.",How did you like the function?,[],[],[],[],[]

Firstly, I purchased the product as a refurbished unit and only paid $75 including shipping - I added two additional batteries quite inexpensively through eBay.It is easily portable and seems to have fairly good battery time - here's a sample of 720 P quality - not bad.  [...]I suspect that this is a generic criticism as the small microphones embedded in this type of a video recorder has no resistance to wind.  What you can expect is that if you are moving and experience when passing across the microphone you will get wind noise.My original intention was to use this video camera on my bicycle and to that end, I constructed a helmet cam mount.  This would probably work but I found that the additional weight on top of my helmet was unacceptable - the camera weighs 4.4 ounces - seemingly trivial but noticeable on top of your head.  At five megapixels, the still picture capability is adequate but nothing special.  I chose to get a ZX3 as opposed to the newer ZX5 - there were several reasons for this choice:The ZX3 has removable batteries, the five does not.  The charge coupled device is larger on the ZX three and quite a few sophisticated reviewers felt that the ZX five was a downgrade in some respects.  And then there was the issue of a dramatically lower price.Summarizing, this camera is good enough and portable enough that I will often carry the camera in situations where I would have been lugging my Canon T1 I.

I was able to get several sharp photographs. However, I could not use it outside, I just could not see the screen in bright light. The only thing I could see was the focus peaking lines which helped me get a few good shots, but most outside shots were out of focus. Also the remote control software was minimal. I also discovered that when the HDMI cable is plugged in, it only supports playback and does not support live view. The battery life was dismal, it is more a function of how long the camera is on rather than the specified number of shots you can take. The battery was good for a few hours, then died.

Seeing the tape I used to build up the end had compressed a lot under the camera battery's retention clip, I improved that fix and the charge and retention are back.

I've had better all-round luck with Power2000 *****I bought this extra battery for my Olympus Stylus with high hopes since a different battery from a different ""No Name"" brand works well in my Canon camera.  On arrival the battery looked just like the Olympus original but when I put it in the camera nothing happened.Since rechargable batteries usually arrive with enough charge to at least turn on the equipment, I wondered if the thing was DOA.  I tried charging the battery several times in the camera without success in any way.  Again I figured DOA.For some reason I eventually tried pressing the battery down lightly inside the battery compartment with my finger and turning the camera on.  ...It worked...  And it worked fine every time I tried it.When installed, the battery is a ""hair"" too short to touch the contacts inside the battery compartment.  The original Olympus battery has NO HINT of this problem.  I roughly compared the Olympus and Maximal batteries side by side.  If there is any difference in length it is very small but apparently enough to cause an issue.I imagine the problems with the battery having no power seen here in a few negative reviews could be from a lesser degree of the same issue, where the power connection is flawed during use or charging so one suspects the thing is no good.The work-around is to build up the end of the battery with tape or something, though such a fix could make switching batteries a real pain given the tight clearances in the battery compartment.I decided to exchange the battery and hope the replacement meets the original spec. better.  I'm encouraged by it's vast majority of 4 and 5 Star reviews.  The battery was provided by Amazon and I managed to discover the problem within Amazon's Return Window so at least the return is going smoothly, supposedly with no extra cost to me for shipping the battery back and receiving it's replacement.The replacement arrived and has the same problem.  Using several layers of scotch tape, I built up the battery end where the tiny clip holds it in the camera.  The battery seems to work fine now while still slipping in and out of the camera easily.The package has a Support number to call.  The person I spoke with didn't know of any problems like mine and recommended I return the battery to Amazon AGAIN and ...get this... TRY AN DIFFERENT BRAND.  AND though it also is marketed for other manufacturer's cameras, this replacement is SUPPOSED to be an EXACT match for the Olympus model my camera takes...It even has the same Model Code on the package (LI42B).Subsequently I was looking at replacements for a Canon NB-6L battery and saw many 1 Star ratings for MaximalPower's NB-6L battery noting that the thing was TOO BIG to fit, although otherwise that battery also has a high rating.",Is the review rating not good ?,['4 and 5 Star reviews' '4 and 5 Star reviews'],[2211 2211],[1 1],[0. 0.],[False False]

We only used them when on long trips.  Recently I wanted to start using them for shorter trips making the bulky laptop device inconvenient.  I purchased the Garmin because it has very good ratings and is very portable.  I also like the elevation option and how easily it can be selected.So on my first drive I enjoyed the map, the warnings and clear turn announcements.  It also gives a clear indication of upcoming interchanges and what lane you need to be in to get off on the correct ramp.  This the laptop software was not so great at.  It has so far tested very very well at navigation.  That is what we buy them for isn't it?  I also tested it for being able to track my movements, and it was right on.  The Speed indication is a pleasant surprise and it tells you in a moment that you are breaking the speed law.  It also gives a warning when you are approaching a Red Light Camera intersection.Things to be aware of are the maps are not completely up to date, but then most are not.  We have a couple Red Light Camera intersections in town that have existed for well over a year or two now and the Garmin did not know the cams are watching the traffic at a couple of them.  ALSO be sure to know where you are going and the route because they seem to ignore the ROUTE NUMBER and call some highways by a ROAD NAME, which I did not recognize.  In my area, the ROUTE NUMBER is used as the name, NOBODY KNOWS the road name and it isn't posted.  This is a major highway that GARMIN chose to call by a street name that I have never heard of.  To take this further, I was traveling south and the same problem with the ROUTE NUMBER being ignored came up.  I found some street names I was very unfamiliar with.Also, I drove by a couple of streets which used to be drive through but have been adapted to ""no exit"" or ""DEAD END"" roads for traffic control..This adaptation occurred years ago but the map does not indicate this.  I am not saying the Garmin unit is bad, AS a matter of fact, I really like it now that I know what to watch for.  But the map supplier seems lacking in some small cases.  I strongly suggest being aware of where you are going and possibly carry a map in case the Garmin gets you into something that it can't show a reality map for.One VERY HELPFUL THING  was when trying to program a favorite place.  ONE location I needed to save was very rurual so the map only shows a main road and not much else.  Find the approximate location where you want to find an address, tap the ""PLUS"" on the screen.  As as the map magnifies, it will start to show more roads .  Once your road comes up, tap along the road for the addresses.  It will only display one address at a time and you will be hunting for your address. If the address does not show, hit the PLUS and try again. Just keep tapping until the address you need comes up.  You may need to move up or down the road to find your address, when you do, save as your favorite.  This Garmin is new to me so this was unexpected as the screen shows nothing but a main road when the map is first accessed in rurual areas.  Keep in mind that if the road is not on the screen, tap the plus to get closer and it will appear.  Then tap for the address locations. I was really glad this function is available.  It will be really useful.My over all experience is good and I really like the portability and ease of programming favorites and such.  Get it and enjoy it but be aware of it's qwerks and you'll have a good travel adventure.",What did you think of that thing?,[],[],[],[],[]

I've tried Cyber Acoustic products against Logitech and Altec Lansing, and these speakers are by far the best in their category.Firstly, the satellite tower design includes two speakers per tower, which helps distribute sound over a greater area than with single speaker designs. This greatly improves the listening experience, as the ""sweet spot"" area has widened so listeners perceive full-sounding stereo from a variety of locations in a small room. Additionally this avoids the pitfalls of ""small"" computer speakers which sound small, like music playing from a tin box. (the CA speakers 1 level below these with a single speaker design by comparison sound MUCH worse).Secondly, the bass and speakers are very powerful for their size, and have little to no distortion even at full-volume.The sub-woofer volume is adjustable independently of the other speakers. This lets you boost bass for music genres with a lot of low-frequency sounds, such as electronic/dance or hip-hop/rap, and likewise decrease bass for genres like classical and acoustic where the bass could overwhelm the instruments or vocals.The cord is conveniently long ans contains a circular volume control with a headphone jack and aux input.NOTE: I have two of these speaker systems because a roommate dropped a satellite speaker and broke the plastic foot. They are plenty sturdy if you respect them and should last a long time if handle them carefully. I guess that also shows how good these speakers are, that they broke and I bought them again.I'm a recording enthusiast, and these speakers satisfy my needs. They are not studio monitors but it's definitely possible to create good mixes on them. They take up considerably less space than professional studio monitors and are hundreds of dollars cheaper, but the sound quality is not significantly worse than monitors I've tried. They are easily 10x better than integrated speakers in TVs, laptops, etc. and they are a few steps above every speaker set in the less than $70 price range.",How is the volume of the unit?,['full-volume' 'volume is adjustable'],[800 827],[1 1],[0.55 0.55],[ True  True]

There's some setup you can choose to do, like adding the date info, etc - it all takes seconds and then you're done.I initially shot about 10 mins of video and then plugged it in to my MacBook Pro running Snow Leopard.  It immediately mounted on the desktop, Flip software launched, and the video was sitting there ready for viewing and sharing.  There wasn't a single second of setup time on the computer... not even my iPhone can get video done this well and this quickly.  In fact, I've been carrying the MinoHD pretty much everywhere now - it's just a better video experience, period.The Flip software is really very good and it worked just as well on a Windows 7 machine as it did on my Mac at home. The camera itself is built extremely well, and Flip added nice touches that most manufacturers don't think matter.  Great example: When recording video the aluminum glows red around the glass and lens to let people know the camera is on. They could have just put a red LED somewhere on it, but they really went the extra distance and designed that kind of stuff IN to the case.The USB connector is really solid, too. It folds back in to the case, and a tiny switch flips it out when needed.  This is also how it charges! No issues getting the battery to full from my laptop's USB port in a short amount of time, and the longevity is fantastic.The video is really, really good.

Of course, if you want these to thump, thump they will, but I'd still recommend to EQ them, just pushing the bass frequencies up a bit.

I hate to use the word investment, because we know camera equipment is definitely NOT an investment.  I bought it because I heard so much about it, and, I had a 50mm back in my old film days.  I have not  been disappointed.  I will agree with  many here who say that at F1.8 the results are less than stellar.  This is true--- there is a lack of contrast, not necessarily sharpness (at least in my copy of the lens) that you will notice.  Since I know that as a fact going in to a shoot or session, I set my aperture at F2.0, or F2.2 on my D700, or D300.  This solves the problem.  The resulting images at F 2.0 and above are amazingly sharp, and clear.

Personally, I'm lazy and hate zooming with my feet, but I'd much rather do that with this lens, than either using flash, or blurring photos of important events.The lens finish is plasticy but so what?  Are you going to be banging it around on a regular basis?  My 50mm travels with me just about everywhere either in a camera bag, or in my North Face Recon backpack (not a camera backpack) just about everywhere, and I pump about 80,000 images a year per body, between landscapes, motorsports, portraits, etc.  So far, so good.  It does stand up to a beating.  I do not use any protective filter on it as the glass is relatively well recessed on this lens.When I do need to use filters such as polarizers, or ND's, I have step-up rings that take the lens from the 52mm size to 77mm which is the standard size of all my filters. It does look ""strange"" having the tiny little 50mm lens hidden behind a huge 77mm filter, but it WORKS.Again, if you are looking to make an investment -- there's that ugly word again, make that acquisition, to your photo gear you can't go wrong at this price point; If you wind up hating it, there's always the ability to return it, or sell it on eBay.Enjoy.",How would you describe the texture of the lens at all focal lengths above 150mm?,[],[],[],[],[]

It gives three nice progressive (rolling) green lights on the side as it charges, progress-bar style.

electronics,more vivid,color,stunning,quality,d467eb94bf8f94e2650ea5d16ec4daa8,1,0.5,False,e884f66159043823040843d60ff5cf8a,672bb198fbf5bf77b8caddec7186b939,B0035FZJHQ,"Whether you're new to the world of DSLRs, or are a seasoned photographer who wants to try your luck at video, the Canon Rebel T2i is perfect. I've had nothing but great experiences with it so far, and highly recommend to everyone.Other than the T2i, I own (and primarily shoot with) the Rebel XS (1000D), and also have extensive experience with the Canon 50D. While my XS still serves me very well, I wanted to get an SLR with video capabilities since the release of the T1i. After finally saving up enough for the T1i, I really lucked out that Canon announced the T2i, which has even better features! I am lucky enough to finally have it, and want to share my experiences, and how they compare to my expectations==================OVERALL IMPRESSIONSThe camera is very small and light. It is not weather-sealed or as durable as some of the more expensive SLRs, but it doesn't ""feel cheap"" in my opinion. It features a 3-inch LCD (compared to the Rebel XS's 2.5 inch screen), which also has a very high resolution. It looks lovely! Auto-focus is fast, and I've been very pleased with the quality of the pictures and videos I've taken so far.==================PROSIMAGE QUALITY: I feared that cramming so many megapixels onto this sensor, there would be a lot of image 'noise' (the megapixel myth). This thankfully hasn't been an issue, and I've been very pleased with the pictures taken with this camera! Aside from White Balance issues (see below, Cons), image quality is pretty good!VIDEO: Some people have disparagingly said that Video on DSLRs is just a gimmick. I disagree. Based on sample clips I'd seen on YouTube, I was excited about getting an HDSLR, and while videos are sometimes shaky if you don't have very steady hands, a tripod eliminates those concerns. Audio quality on the T1i was criticized by many, but the T2i has a microphone input jack, which allows you to connect a mic. I don't yet own one so can't comment on that feature, but will update this review if and when I save enough to try this feature out. Additionally, this offers improved recording options, including higher fps (frames per second) than the T1i, which technically offered ""true HD"" recording of 1080, but only at a choppy 20 fps.LOW-LIGHT PERFORMANCE: I am much more impressed than I expected. My Rebel XS could go up to ISO 1600, but would perform pretty poorly there. This not only can go up to a significantly higher ISO level, but performs much better. Less image noise means you have to waste less time editing your pics, and many more keepers!SDXC SUPPORT: Only own SDHC cards up until now, but it's great to know that this supports the next generation of flash storage, which means you'll in the future be able to hold many more pictures than currently available.CONSNOT A FULL-FRAME SLR: This is not a full-frame SLR like the Canon 5D Mark II, and the APS-C sized sensor results in a crop factor (1.6x), and doesn't necessarily provide the same image quality as the larger, full-frame sensor does. Still, at less than half the cost of the Mark II, I think this is a trade-off that's well worth it for most users.Crop factor means that this camera, like other Canon DSLRs that have the APS-C size image sensor, will not be true to the lens's designation. A 50mm lens will produce an image more in line with 50mm x 1.6, or 80mm on a full-frame. This not only makes a difference for those who want to do landscape photography (which usually benefits from wide-angle views), but for those with unsteady hands. The general logic is that to ensure a steady shot, you need to shoot at the reciprocal of your focal length. So for a 50mm focal length, you should be shooting at a speed faster than 1/50 second for a steady shot. Keeping the crop factor in mind, you really should be shooting at a speed faster than 1/80 a second.Crop factors are common for most digital SLRs, as full-frame sensors jack up the cost of production, which are then passed on to the consumer in the form of very expensive cameras. So it's not so much a shortcoming of the Rebel T2i, but just a note to keep in the back of your mind.DIFFERENT BATTERY: This is more of a hassle for those who owned spare batteries than for those whose first SLR would be the T2i, but Canon changed the battery. Again, not such a big deal, but might be a hassle for some who find out that their old batteries can't be used on this model.WHITE BALANCE: I found that the 'Auto' White-Balance setting was wildly inaccurate on my Rebel XS (often giving indoor shots a yellow tint unless I changed the WB to the 'Incandescent Light' mode), and I feel that the WB settings on this model still aren't as accurate as they should be. If you want truly accurate WB, you can use a gray card, or an alternative would be to simply try digitally editing the photos on your computer after shooting.NO ARTICULATING SCREEN: No articulating screen, but this is a rare feature in DSLR's in general, so it's not a shortcoming of the T2i. Since most of your shots will probably be composed using the viewfinder, not a big deal, although it would have been convenient! If you absolutely must have an articulating screen on an HDSLR, look into the Nikon D5000.===================A NOTE ABOUT THE KIT LENSThe lens that comes with this is the standard 18-55 f/3.5-5.6 that comes with the other Rebels. It's a very good all-around lens, but you more likely than not will want to at some point upgrade your lens for either (a) better image quality, or (b) better performance in low-light conditions.This lens is very good, but for pros or those who pay incredibly close attention to detail, the optical quality of Canon's higher-end lenses is superior than to the kit lens. For most users, I don't think image quality will be a huge issue.More likely, the aperture size will be the reason people want to upgrade their lens over time.  A lens with a wider aperture allows more light to reach the sensor in less time than a lens with a narrower aperture. That means you can employ a faster shutter speed, which allows you to snap the shot faster, reducing the likelihood of a blurry picture. Outdoors on a sunny day, this aperture range of this lens won't be a limiting factor; inside a poorly-lit gym, however, you'll notice some blurry shots (see below for a recommended alternative for low-light shooting).Still, this is a pretty good all-around lens that can result in some great shots!===================RECOMMENDED ACCESSORIES1. An external flash: This will come in very handy. With the built-in flash, your photos often come out harshly lit. Bouncing an external flash off the wall makes a huge difference in image quality. I personally use the Speedlite 580EX II, but there are cheaper alternatives that are very good. Some higher-end cameras (i.e. Canon 5D Mark II) don't even have a built-in flash, which goes to show something about how high-level photographers view the lighting provided by internal flashes.2. 50mm f/1.8 II lens - At around one hundred dollars, this lens is relatively cheap when compared to others on the market. Despite its low price, it offers great image quality. While it lacks IS (image stabilization) like some other Canon lenses (including the kit lens), with a wide aperture of f/1.8, enough light usually comes in to ensure a fast shutter speed, which in turn minimizes camera shake. Keep in mind that as a 'prime' lens, your feet will have to do the zooming in and out. This is not as convenient as an everyday walk-around lens like the 18-55 kit lens which gives a good zoom range, but is a great lens for portraits. Also would ideally be a good option for poorly-lit places where the aperture of the kit-lens isn't wide enough to ensure a steady shot.CONCLUSIONSFrom my list of 4 pros and 4 cons, you might wonder why I'm giving this product 5 stars?... It's because considering the great performance - and low price - of the T2i, the 'cons' I list really aren't that big of a deal. Just because some cameras offer the aforementioned features the T2i lacks, it doesn't mean the T2i isn't a solid performer.  On the contrary, I have been completely satisfied with this camera's image and video quality, performance, features, AND PRICE, and would recommend the T2i to anyone looking for an affordable way to capture memories!------------------EDIT 11/27/10I just wanted to update this review to say that after shooting with the T2i for nearly half a year, I'm still as impressed by this camera as when I first got it. I have a few comments to expand on my initial review:VIDEO  I have been using the video mode a lot more than I initially expected. While it doesn't offer continuous auto-focus and therefore might not replace a camcorder, once you get the hang of manually focusing this is not a big problem. I many times have found myself in situations where photos couldn't capture the moment as well as a video could, and the ability to record clips has been very convenient.A note on the video mode, however...while it's automatic exposure is fine for most situations, if you find your videos are grainy, it's best to manually control the exposure. I've seen that sometimes even in good lighting, the camera will keep the aperture small (to have a less shallow depth of field) and boost the ISO. You can get around that by manually adjusting exposure settings, but again, the automatic exposures are usually fine.As for audio with videos, I personally still have not purchased an external microphone, but for those who are serious about movie production Amazon sells a highly popular 'Rode VideoMic' for a reasonable price. I have looked up videos on YouTube which demonstrate the difference between the built-in mic and an external mic, and while it's  tempting, I'd rather spend my money on better lenses than audio accessories.CROP FACTOR  To clarify on my 'crop factor' point from above on a full-frame vs. a crop-sensor body, there is a useful video on Vimeo that illustrates what I'm talking about. If you Google '5D 7D crop factor Vimeo' it comes up as the first result. As you can see, a full frame camera offers a view truer to the lens designations. Again, full frame cameras are costlier to make and therefore more expensive to the consumer, so APS-C sensor cameras like the Rebel T2i, 60D, and 7D are very good values for the money. But if you are not on a tight budget and think you might one day want to upgrade to a full frame some day for the improved low-light performance, higher image quality, and wider field of view, maybe skip on a T2i and just aim for a 5D Mark II (I personally love my T2i, but am excited about some day having my 24-105 shoot wider than its current effective 38-168 range.). For most users, however, APS-C sensor cameras like the T2i should be great, and some might even find the crop factor useful for telephoto work.LENSES  After spending so much money on a camera body, many people have a difficult time justifying buying expensive lenses, and I understand that. After upgrading from the 18-55mm kit lens to the 24-105L lens, however, I can honestly say that the money is well worth it. Colors are more vivid and truer to real life than the [now noticeably] duller colors produced by the non-L lens, and I rarely use the kit lens now. Again, the 18-55 is very versatile and provides a great value, but if you can afford to upgrade your lens to Canon's L series, you won't regret it. Perhaps try before you buy, to see for yourself what I'm talking about.LOW LIGHT  While this camera offers a boost ISO mode (to 12800 from 6400), I don't use that since its results are too grainy for my liking. But for night shots without a tripod, I have found ISO 3200 and 6400 to be a real advantage over my previous Rebel XS which only went up to ISO 1600, and even then produced noisier images than the T2i at 1600. While this camera doesn't produce high ISO pictures as cleanly as a full frame 5DMk2 does, at a fraction of the price I am incredibly pleased with this camera.MEMORY CARD  Lastly, I wanted to recommend you do a lot of research into which SD card you want to use. Class 6 or higher is recommended, but look into reviews to see how the card actually performs. I used to use a Transcend Class 6 card since it's very affordable, and have had movies abruptly stop recording at inopportune times. I upgraded to a Transcend Class 10, and unfortunately continue to have that happen. Not all Class 10 cards necessarily write at the same speed, so look thoroughly into reviews if you plan on using video mode to ensure you get a reliable, high-speed card. The Transcend cards are a great value for the money, and have many times been fine, but you might want to consider more expensive alternatives for greater reliability.------------------EDIT 01/28/11I wanted to update this review to reflect the fact that the camera is still serving me well, and to recommend some additional accessories I have since paired my T2i with. I recently got theInduro AKB0 Tripod Kit (Black),Joby GP8-BHEN Gorillapod Focus with Ballhead X bundle,Dolica WT-1003 67-Inch Lightweight Monopod, andCanon EF 70-200mm f/2.8L II IS USM Telephoto Zoom Lens for Canon SLR Cameras, and highly recommend them.CAMERA SUPPORT  With the T2i you can pull off handheld shots in low light by cranking up the ISO, but even though the T2i shows relatively little noise, it does show more than some would like in their shots (especially at ISO 6400). Digital noise can be reduced in post-production, but it's much easier to shoot at a lower ISO in the first place, especially for night shots. After paying so much for a camera body and other accessories, buying an expensive tripod might be the last thing you'd want to do, and I understand that: for a while I was using an older, cheaper tripod that was designed more for light camcorders than SLRs with heavy lenses. While this set-up technically worked, I didn't feel very confident in its reliability. After doing a lot of research and asking many photographers, I got the Induro kit, and have been very happy with it so far. It is more expensive than I would have liked, but it doesn't make sense to skimp on support and risk damaging your gear! With tripods, you have to make trade-offs between price, sturdiness, and weight, and while I'm happy with my tripod, it might not be adequate for your needs. There are many websites with tips on what to look for in a tripod (i.e. ball head, pan-tilt head, etc) that can help you make an informed decision. The Gorillapod is not nearly as essential to your shooting as a dedicated tripod, but I recommend it if you find yourself in situations where you don't want to/might not be permitted to carry a tripod, but need support. It sets up much faster than a tripod which needs to have its legs extended and locked. Lastly, a monopod is a great way to stabilize your shots without the hassle of having to carry a tripod, and is even more portable than a Gorillapod. That being said, it doesn't provide as much stability, so I use it primarily to stabilize video shooting (which can be a bit shaky due to composition through LCD screen instead of viewfinder, especially with a telephoto lens).TELEPHOTO LENS  The T2i has a high resolution sensor that, in my experience, provides for great shots even after cropping. I have taken shots and cropped to 100% and been pleased with results, but sometimes you want extended reach without cropping, and here a good telephoto really shines. Canon and third-party lens manufacturers offer many great telephoto options for the T2i, and it's important to think of what you need a telephoto lens for before investing in one. If you'll primarily be shooting with a tripod, you probably don't need IS; if you're going to be shooting in adequate light, a wide aperture isn't essential. I used the Canon 70-300 non-L non-IS lens, but don't recommend it. Keeping in mind the reciprocity of focal length and shutter speed, Image Stabilization on a telephoto lens makes things much easier for hand-held shooting. I much preferred the 55-250 IS over my 70-300 non-IS (there are also IS versions of the 70-300), but found its low-light performance was weak due to its relatively small maximum aperture size. I recently got the 70-200 2.8 IS II, and am blown away by its fast auto-focus, great low-light performance, and superior optical quality. It is an expensive lens, but is well worth it if you need a fast lens (wide aperture) that features Image Stabilization.--------------------------EDIT 02/07/11 *FINAL UPDATE*NEW REBEL  The T2i's successor, the T3i has just been announced, and will be available in March. Based on its specs, I don't think this is a necessary upgrade for current T2i owners. The main improvements found in the T3i are a swiveling screen, wireless flash transmitter, improved Auto mode detection, an enhanced Movie Zoom mode, and creative filters. Of these, I think the most important or sought-after improvements are the flash transmitter (which is is great for advanced shooters and those who want to explore with lighting) and the swiveling LCD screen (which allows for more flexibility in shooting). While these are useful new features, they are largely incremental and I will be sticking with my T2i. For new buyers, the T3i looks great and is very worth looking into when it comes out. Canon also announced a T3 camera to succeed the Rebel XS, which is great for beginners but is lacking in features compared to the T2i and the newly-announced T3i, including the ability to capture 'true HD' at 1080. Even with Canon's recent announcements, I think the T2i is a great DSLR and I highly recommend it to everyone.----------------------------EDIT 06/13/11 *THIS REALLY IS THE FINAL UPDATE*I know this review is now longer than some novels, but I really can't stress enough how great this camera is. I've used this in a variety of settings, both professionally and for personal use, and it's served me so well throughout. While I've shot events before, last night I shot the Tony Awards in NYC...which meant many thousands of shots over the course of many hours...and I was highly impressed with the T2i's performance. I did have to change batteries during the course of the event, but that was many hours into the event. You can easily get a spare third-party battery for just a few bucks.I recently purchased a cheap (less than 20 dollars) intervalometer from Amazon, and have started creating time-lapse videos with my T2i. Setting up cool time-lapse, and capturing HD video, are two areas where an articulating screen (like that found on the T3i and 60D) would come in handy, but again, this is not an essential feature, so I am pleased with my T2i. The intervalometer I got through Amazon was third-party, but since it cost about a tenth of the official Canon one, I am very pleased and highly recommend it if you want to take your T2i to the next level.The T2i is an amazing camera. I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone who is even remotely interested, whether you never owned an SLR before, or want a second body as a backup.

I finally settled on this one due to the following:Right size for my small handsErgonomicSomewhat ambidextrous.  I am left handed but typically use the right hand for the mouse (gee I wonder why that is.. gripe, gripe, gripe about the lack of good left handed mice!)  I could get away with using it in my left hand if needed (due to nerve pain I have to switch between my left and right hand as needed) but not for long term use.Had the unifying receiverFeatures: Had all the features I could possibly want or need.  I loved the hyper scroll and application switcher.  The buttons were unobtrusive and I never hit them unintentionally.I tested several other unifying receiver mice made by logitech and this was the one that fit my ergonomic needs the best.  TheLogitech Wireless Anywhere Mouse MX for PC and Macdoes have a good selection of features but it was too small.  TheLogitech Wireless Performance Mouse MX for PC and Macwas too big and not at all for left handed use.  TheLogitech LX7 Cordless Optical Mouse - Dark Blue ( 931395-0403 )is my backup mouse and is OK and theLogitech Wireless Mouse M505 (Black)was the next choice if just going off of ergonomics and comfort, but for the price and lack of features I decided to look outside of Logitech.What I found instead was theMicrosoft Explorer Mini Mouse.  This mouse fit similarly to the M705 and it is MUCH lighter and MUCH cheaper!  It also works better in my left hand then the M705.Like I said in my title, I wanted to love this mouse but it was so defective I didn't even want to try a second one. If you want to play roulette to see if you don't get a defective one (seeing some reviews I'm not the only one who got a defective one) then here's my pro's and cons list:PROSErgonomicComfortableUnifying ReceiverApplication SwitcherHyper ScrollUnobtrusive specialty buttonsCONSHeavyNot ambidextrousQuality (if you're like me it will be defective!)I hope this review was helpful!  If you suffer from nerve damage in your neck, arms and/or wrists (like I do) I ended up with theLogitech K350 2.4Ghz Wireless KeyboardandMicrosoft Explorer Mini Mouse.  I do graphic work from my PC and play computer games.  So far both these work perfectly.  The only down side is that I now have two wireless receivers on my desk rather than the one.

I created the account and was presented with a new way to manage my router.  The new way has a new (and improved) management screen that makes it easy to manage, it takes some time to get used to, but it is very user friendly (I am used to the more technical way, so I have to look closer through the options to find most stuff).  The system is nice since you can access it from different computers without using your home network.  You can now use neat apps to limit the network (like content and media and protect your network), most apps are advertised and some are available for Android, but most say coming soon for iPhone.  Some look promising and the new system is neat.  I look forward to the improved version for iPhone (over Cisco Connect Home). -- One thing to point out, the Cisco Cloud will log you out if you do not stay active (kind of bad for your own router...), but the device list customization is nice and you can add custom names and images for each item (to easily recognize suspicious devices.The iPhone app is also available in the Apple App Store and is a small install.  Once I logged in (with the account I created when I launched the router page), from the app you can see the status of your network (is it connected to internet, who [what devices] are connected), you can also edit most parts of the router settings (not the more advanced stuff, like the QoS, Gaming, and Internet settings), but you can edit passwords, wireless names and passwords, and guest access.  Pretty neat, and it will be fun to see what other apps become available that make this even better.I also wanted to add that when I tried to add my USB Storage device, I ran into trouble.  I had the drive formatted in exFAT (I did not want the 4GB file size limitation of FAT 32 nor a specific to Windows or Mac (since I use both)).  I plugged in the drive and the Cloud Connect did not recognize it.  I contacted support and they informed me that the router only supports: FAT32, NTFS and HFS+ formats.  So, I wanted to let you all know, just in case you try to use it with a LINUX formatted or exFAT formatted drive.  I am going to format it into NTFS and use the network only to connect to it from my Mac.  Once it was formatted for NTFS, the Cisco Connect Cloud recognized it instantly.  The settings were easy to understand and there were easy options to setup FTP settings for accessing files over the internet (I did not want this, since I just wanted to share the drive on the local network).  When I opened Finder on my Mac I could get to my drive over the router name in Shared section.  The USB storage section also included addresses to access your storage drive.I was excited to see this router after seeing the online push and emails that Cisco has sent out advertising there new Router with Apps.  I was curious on what they would utilize with the Apps.  Since my E4200v2 and E2000 both support the Cisco Connect Express app from my iPhone.  Apparently the big app, that is what all the buzz is about is the Cisco Connect Cloud.  I looked around for it, and it is not advertised on the box or on many sites, so I finally found it on the Cisco website, but it apparently will not be available until the Summer (I always believe that stuff should not be released until all the features are available, with apps and cloud based services this type of delay has become quite prominent). So I cannot use the main new feature until later...  Cisco says once it is available the Cisco Connect app/software will alert me.  As soon as it is available I will definitely try it out, but I have a fear with that high amount of Upstream traffic will slow my network down (I have AT&T; DSL), so I am curious about it, and will update my review when it is available.Now for the router itself:Like I said, I am updating from a Linksys E4200v2 to the Linksys EA4500.  So far there is no difference.  They have the exact specs (from what I see), just the new one has app enabled (for an app that is not out yet...)So Since they are near identical routers, installation was similar.  I never like using the install CDs, since I do not want there software on my computers.  So I plugged into the router using a network cable, and went to the router's home page (192.168.1.1).  The default setting is username: admin, password: admin.  I then from the main page set up my DSL connection, so since I have AT&T; DSL, I selected PPPoE, then inserted my att email and then my password (provided by your DSL provider), it is a different approach for Cable Internet (MAC Cloning is the easiest), although if you are not sure how to do this you might want to go with the software, I am familiar with setting up networks, so it is easier to do it manually.  Set your routers IP here, and the range of addresses for leasing (you can just use the default, unless you need more than 50 devices, then change it accordingly).I then went to the Wireless tab and set up Manual WiFi settings, I like broadcasting on the 2.4 and 5GHz so I can manually connect my 5GHz devices to this network and my 2.4GHz to there network (although 2.4GHz devices cannot see the 5GHz broadcast).  I gave each network a recognizable name for my network, and then used WPA-2 Personal for encryption, make sure to use at least two combinations (numbers + letters or + symbols), it makes brute force attacks nearly impossible due to time required (I use letters + numbers + symbols).\I then set up the Guest Access (which can be done from the web interface, this was not possible on the E2000s), I gave it a name and a password and limited it to 5 guests.  Guest access creates a network separate from your main network, different IP address group for the two (for example my home is 192.168.1.XXX, and my guest is 192.168.3.XXX), this way guest cannot see my machines on my main network.  A neat feature when relatives come over.I then went over to Quality of Service and set my Media Center, Roku 2, and Skype Applications as High Priority to ensure that they work properly even if I have a lot of activity on other devices.I also went into the DHCP Reservation (Home page toward bottom), and gave my Printer a Static IP address.  To do this go to DHCP and then if you see your printer in the list check the box next to it and hit Add, then give it a name and Static address.  You then need to tell the printer to use that Static IP (this ensures proper behavior).  If you do not see your item yet in the Client list, you can get your MAC address from the device (make sure to get Wireless if you plan to connect wirelessly or Wired if you plan to connect over Wire (they are different MAC addresses, even in the same machine! [Separate network devices]).  Then in the DHCP Client type in a name, your preferred IP address and then the MAC address.  I do this for printers to ensure that computers that connect to it using its IP address stay connected even if the network reboots and issues out new IP addresses (it takes a little extra time, but is worth it to ensure devices like Printers stay active on the network).This device can have USB HDD and USB Printer plugged in to serve as a file or print server.  This is great for people who have older USB printers and want to share it across the network without keeping a PC running all the time just to host it.  The file sharing is also nice for large USB HDD that you want access to over the network.In the end this is a great router, has some great features and is easy to install and monitor (whether you use the Cisco Connect or the Web Interface), I look forward to playing with the Cisco Connect Cloud (and wish that when devices come out that their new features were available at release), but in the end if you need a router able to handle larger networks, and high entense applications (I canceled Satellite for Internet Streaming and Off Air broadcasting (HD HomeRun to Media Center Computer with Hulu Desktop) and Roku 2, and canceled home phone for a Skype subscription.  Therefore, I need a router that can handle this type of network activity, and these routers (EA4500, E4200v2) have worked perfectly and never have any problem keeping my network live!

I initially purchased a 6ft HDMI cable made by Monster Cable for around $80 for the the connection from the receiver to the TV and needed 3 additional HDMI cables for the rest of my media centers connections. After some extensive research and shopping around I decided on these and I could not be happier. The build quality of these is exceptional. They are thick and well shielded and the picture and sound quality is equal to that of the 8x more expensive Monster cables.

I'll speak personally from how this has helped me in my specific situation, in case there is someone who may be in a similar situation.There are a few things about me that made me a great fit for this product:1) I own a desktop computerThere are some things I need a desktop for, and I have a desktop computer for those occasions. Interestingly, one of the things I learned is how little I really needed my desktop. I packed it away and didn't bother unpacking it for two months now. If anything it's probably a good thing that I can't play video games on this thing, so if you're a recovered game addict with relapsing tendencies (like yours truly), that's something to consider. But there are some things I'll definitely need the desktop for, such as photo editing, which I will eventually need to unpack the desktop to do.2) I use Google everything (gmail, drive, calendar, etc.)And so do a lot of my friends, making it very easy to work on Google and share my work with others. The suite of Google office products are pretty handy, and for most uses is more than sufficient. Because google docs do not count against your size limit on Google Drive, it feels like unlimited storage to me, and I've done just fine without any additional storage.3) I use Amazon Prime (mainly for movies, Kindle books)The vast majority of ""apps"" that you can add on the chromebook do little more than provide you a link, turning the bottom bar into a glorified ""favorites"" bar. The kindle is one exception, since you are able to download books for offline reading. Since I watch all my movies through Amazon Prime, it's not a big deal that there's no DVD player.4) I intend to carry this around all over the placeThis is ideal for carrying around because it's light and thin (I just leave it in my bag and I never think ""dang it, I shouldn't have brought my laptop today"") the battery life is great (I never really have to bring the charger unless I forgot to charge it the night before) and it's cheap (I've dropped it and I've dropped the bag it's in many times, but it hasn't broken yet, and I wouldn't be totally bummed as I would be if I dropped some other really expensive thin light laptop).5) The places I go have wifi anywayStarbuck's, McDonald's, school, library, etc. In my neighborhood there are a lot of places to go for free wifi.A few reasons why this product was not a good fit:1) Skydrive is not that good.This isn't Google's fault, but it does affect my review of whether or not you should buy this chromebook, because the chromebook is only as good as the apps that what it can run in the browser. The truth is that Skydrive is nowhere close to the much more robust Google Drive. It technically does a lot of the same things, and in some ways it is indeed better than Google drive at handling MS Office documents, but I've had too many instances where the website would fail and I would lose something I had been working on. No matter how many bells and whistles it has, the fact that it can't reliably work on things has made me lose hope on skydrive, so now if I really want to fine-tune a MS Office document, I have to find a PC.2) It's kind of weak sauce.It's okay with most things, and I can watch movies on it full-screen, but sometimes it's just slow, especially if you have a lot of tabs open. I've learned to be a lot more disciplined about tab-closing, and that's helped, but at some point the thing is just slow, and when I'm trying to work with two windows at the same time, scheduling things and responding to e-mails and such, there's a slight lag that will make things take longer than they would otherwise.CONCLUSION:If you're a no-frills kind of person and you're looking for something like this, then I recommend it, especially if you're broke like me. It doesn't have a lot of (or any, really) bells or whistles, but it can get quite a bit done. The times are a-changin', and as the cloud expands in the size and diversity of products they offer, this will become even more useful over time.",How do you have the number?,[],[],[],[],[]

On top of that, it did not make sense to me to pay over $60/mo more for cable tv when I do not watch tv for weeks at a time and have a limited selection of shows that I like when I do.  The Roku helped me to understand that I did not have to pay a monthly rental fee for a tv box in order to get HDTV.  My tv resolution is great. Set up is simple.  Plus, it is like getting tv on demand for a numerous selection of my all time favorite shows.  I watch what I like when I want- even if it's 2 am.  I do miss the court tv shows, like Judge Judy, and I would rather watch the regular news broadcast rather than 2 minute snippets.  But, I love being able to pick and choose what I want to pay for. I subscribe to Hulu for $8 per month and Netflix for $8 per month. This combined with Amazon Prime gives me a large selection to shows and movies. I can even take the box with me and watch a movie with a friend - by simply taking the box with me when I visit.  Watch a movie with someone else and you have paid for the cost of Netflix. I love the overwhelming selection plus the search options. I also like that I can use my iPad as a remote control for my tv or to browse on Roku while watching tv.  The very best part is that my cable bill is lower and my selection is better.  More for less?  Works for me.",How is the offer of apps on this tablet?,[],[],[],[],[]

They both just happen to fit perfectly. Knowing that extended exposure to heat is one of the easiest ways to burn out your hardware, I thought I would be proactive and try this setup. At most, the top of my Mac Mini gets just slightly warm to the touch.I expect this fan to extend the life of my devices, assuming the fan itself lasts a while. That is left to be seen.The design of the fan itself is great. It is flat, which is one of the design features that I was particularly looking for. The fan has a connected usb to connect to a power source but what is really cool is that there is a female usb connector on the backside of the fans male usb connection, allowing you to still utilize your usb port. The fan feels rugged and uses hard plastic for the lower components and a metal grill for the top surface. This is an important feature because there are tons of cheap fans on the market that can literally collapse under the weight of a laptop computer which is simply ridiculous.The fan is black so matches most setups aesthetically.It also uses one big single fan, rather than a series of smaller sized fans. The most ideal setup for this type of product is to have one mid size fan in the middle with a smaller size fan at each of the four corners. These fans are obviously more expensive but this is really the optimum design to cool your electronic devices.

It is also very fast.  I clocked it at 57.2Mbps and in the range test, it offered 34.4Mbs.  That was at the 2.4 GHz.  At 5 GHz, it clocked out at 112.6Mbps.  At this speed, I can blast through 500MB of data in just around 30 seconds.  If that is not the fastest router out there, it certainly is in the top few.  When I increased the range to 100 feet, the router still scored 76.1Mbps.However, on the downside, it does not provide a guest network on either its 2.4GHz or 5GHz radios.  I am used to having this feature so when my guests arrive, they do not have access to the files on my computer.  I am not sure why they left this feature out of this router.  Perhaps it is because it has 2 USB ports on this very thin router (to support both a printer and an attached storage device) and support for WDS bridging (you can turn off its router function and use it as a wireless bridge). Alternatively, you can configure the router as a wireless access point.  This paper-thin looks just fine on its stand, but it can just as easily lie flat as a pancake on a shelf or on my desk with its ports facing the wall.Set-up of this ASUS router was quick and easy.  I did not even use the installation CD that came in the box.  I simply used my internet browser (Chrome) and went to 192.168.1.1 and it guided me through a very easy and intuitive set-up procedure.  This Disk-Aid feature also has some other features like setting up a FREE Dynamic DNS address.  I simply had to go to the Disk-Aid and pick a unique name and then after three mouse clicks the service is up and running. After that, I can remotely access the router via the Web address:  xyz.asuscomm.com, where xyz is the unique name I picked out.  This router also supports media streaming and can stream digital content stored on the external hard drive to UPnP-compliant network media streamers.This is a heck of a router for the price.

It was going well, until it melted down (known problem).  I removed the hard disk and we used it as a router only, with less overheating.  That lasted a few weeks until I started hearing panicked hollers from all corners of our condo.  Sure enough, it was time to replace our router.We wound up with the TP-LINK WDR3500.Set up was very easy, using the web browser based interface.We were back up and surfing on all of our devices in around 30 minutes from the arrival of the box until I entered the last password into the last iDevice.Not too bad.  I did set up two different networks though, so the folks who are playing can use one band and the other is used by me.So far everything has been great.  I did have to go through setup once again, after a power outage, but it was even faster than the initial set up, due to familiarity on my part.Right now we have two tablets, an ipod touch, an ailing and ancient macbook, a macmini, an XO/OLPC laptop (linux), a smartphone, and our vonage service all connecting through the TP-LINK TL-WDR3500 without any hiccups.  For the first time in years, I have a reliable wireless connection to my other computer (perfect for when it's monitor croaked) and it has been almost 2 months and my mom hasn't complained about the sound quality when she calls us and it was always an issue (for her) when our vonage box and phones were routed through the Time Capsule.There is only one USB port.  That's not an issue for us.  I did have some trouble getting my Seagate Slim drive to connect and function as a network drive, but because the connection is so seamless and reliable, I have my Labelwriter printer connected to the USB port and I hooked up a larger USB hub to the macmini which I then connected to the router.  That way I can still access everything, but it also gives me an extra layer of protection as the router requires one password and the computer another.I was upset when our Time Capsule petered out, but this router made the transition a positive one and I think I'm done with Time Capsule, but I'd recommend this to friends and family without hesitation.",Do you have any computer with mouse?,[],[],[],[],[]

Until recently, I mostly used either a USB optical mouse or the touchpad on my laptop and did just fine.That being said, I am in the process of building a workstation for video editing.  I decided to invest in a mouse and since I was going with a Mac, I decided I should keep it stylish in case I have clients over - I dropped a hefty amount on a keyboard/mouse setup and was anxious until I hooked the Magic Mouse up.Immediately, I fell in love.  Bluetooth connected seamlessly and the mouse was a dream, even if it didn't have a direct line of sight.  As a matter of fact, I haven't had a single moment of unresponsiveness.The touch controls on the mouse are wonderful.  I normally don't review products, but the ability to swipe between programs and scroll from the mouse is great and practically multiplies productivity.As far as ergonomics go, the mouse is just OK.  It seems like it's just a little too thin, but so far I haven't had any pain, just a little discomfort which I'm going to attribute to a learning curve.The final (fixable) issue is the lack of touch commands supported by Apple.  Because the top half of the mouse is essentially a touch pad, it should be that we can do much more than simply clicking, but this isn't really supported.  Downloading a third party plugin (better touch tool for Mac) solved this problem - I can even launch programs by using a custom hand movement just with my mouse.

I say unfortunately because it lacks the features and customization I've grown to love from tomato (shibby in particular) and dd-wrt.  That said, the performance is excellent and I recommend this over it's n66u cousin.  One of the (two) wireless interfaces on this is a newer broadcom chip with more features that the twin interfaces on the n66u, so even if you don't use ac (yet), you still have a better chip at your disposal.  Unfortunately, going back to the firmware problem, you can't squeeze or customize much out of the new chip with the current firmware and lack of third party offerings, which you currently can with the n66u.just for example, the default tx power, as listed by wl, is 1500 (!) mw (using the latest asuswrt firmware).  That is about 1480 more than I'd like.  Thanks to a user named Merlin, we can download a modified version of asuswrt and customize settings beyond the webinterface, and in using it, I can set the power properly, as well as a bunch of other features (iptables droplists, upnpd custom settings, dnsmasq custom settings, hosts file, cron jobs, and more).  Even by setting the txpower to a sane setting through the webinterface, BTW, it still defaults to 1500 (or 1496ish) for some mysterious reason.  Atleast as reported by wl (the main configuration and settings program published by Broadcom).As for performance, I am very pleased.  I can break 300Mbps using an tri band N adapter w/o problem.  Also pleased with the stability.  Just wish shibby could implement the key features (speed speed speed) of asuswrt firmware into his code so I can use some of those terrific features and bypass the hideous default/stock webinterface.In short, this is a terrific router for the coming years.  At the moment however, the n66u with tomato shibby firmware is probably better.  That said, I don't regret paying the price to be forward compatible.

This one was slightly cheaper (I paid $18.95) and still had free Super Saver Shipping when I bought a micro SD card at the same time.Case fits well, and makes all the difference as far as holding the tablet. Without a case, the tablet is somewhat ""slick"", feeling like it is easier to let slip from the hands. The case fixes all that (as I imagine most cases would). The crease that allows the front flap to fold is in the perfect spot for the thumb to nestle into when gripping.All cutouts were good, especially the one for the camera and LED in back (stylish, shaped cut-out, yet plenty of room for the camera lens). At first I thought the basic fold/insert way of holding the tablet in would not be enough, but it is. The tablet feels very secure and snug once the internal flap is folded around the tablet -- the friction works well.The case closes by using four magnets, two of which are embedded in the part of the case close to the tablet. I had heard that some case magnets interfere with GPS/compass operations. This was not the case for me. For compass apps that only use magnetism, I think this may be true true, at least to some extent, but for full-on GPS, the magnets and case do not appear to cause any issues. I fired up GPS Status after not having used GPS for several weeks, and satellites started becoming visible almost immediately. With A-GPS assistance, I had between 7 and 11 locked in under a minute (I was outside under a clear sky but still in Wi-Fi range from my house). So, GPS and wireless definitely work fine and I have not noticed any degradation since putting the tablet in this case.So, why only 4 stars? Well, the stand functionality leaves a little to be desired. First of all, the plastic slot in back where the leather flap is meant to insert (to create the stand) is very inflexible. So, it is hard to get the flap inserted, and the leather has to deform a bit to get in there. I have not seen any blemishes on the case, but I imagine that over time the flap might warp a bit, and/or if the leather smooths it might pop out of the slot. Also, trying to stand up such a small tablet (7-inch) is a bit wobbly in this case, but that is mostly due to the nature of the folds being so close together and the leather still being fairly rigid.Overall, though, a great case for the price. I like the stylish white stitching, and the case is well-built.  And like I said, several cases are sold in the 20-25 dollar range, so it is nice that this one clocks in at below $19 (though that price is subject to change, I suppose...)",How are case?,['several cases are sold in the 20-25 dollar range' 'Lots of decent'],[2479    0],[1 1],[0. 0.],[False False]

They're Sennheisers and you usually can't go wrong with this brand.The headphone reproduces the full range of sounds very clearly and without distortion, if set up properly (I'll get to that).I've been able to walk around my home without experiencing too much distortion. Within the same room as the transmitter, the sound is really clear and robust. It's great not being tethered to one location or having to deal with accidentally yanking the cord out when moving around.Also, unlike my other enclosed-type headphones, the design allow for air to circulate freely. So your ears won't become uncomfortable warm during use. These headphones are very comfortable.As far as specs, you can get a good assessment of the product from reading the Amazon description so I won't go into that.For portable devices with a headphone jack, you simply have to purchase a ""2-RCA (female) to headphone jack (male 3.5mm plug) adapter"". Make sure the adapter is a ""stereo"" adapter versus a ""mono"" adapter. They look exactly the same, so beware. These adapters are pretty inexpensive.I was a little concerned about getting wireless headphones because of all the negative reviews I've read regarding sound quality, interference, etc.Sound quality and hissing can be minimized if you set up properly. Here's a quick ""What to do"":Portable Players (i.e. CD, MP3, Walkman, etc):1) If the device comes with an output other than the headphone jack, use it. This other output (line-out) is usually a jack that delivers a constant, high (i.e. loud) signal. Regardless of your headphone volume level, this jack will output at a constant, strong, loud signal. These line-out jacks are usually found on the back of some CD players.2) If the device only comes with a headphone jack, set the volume to max or near max. This is the setup I'm using. These headphones were bought primarily to be use at work, so I can listen to my iPod wirelessly.NOTE!!! If you're connected to a dedicated home amp/receivers/etc... DO NOT crank the volume all the way up or even remotely close to it. (The line out on your home amp/receiver will transmit a strong, clear signal regardless of the volume setting, if you're connected to the receiver/amp's line-out)The volume should be set high ONLY for smaller, portable devices that output less power such as an MP3 player or handheld portable CD player. You've been warned;-)Why set the signal coming from your unit as high as possible? It significantly reduces the background noise, since the signal being transmitted is strong. You won't need to turn up the volume on your headset as high since the signal being transmitted is strong. Yes, your portable music player will use up power faster, but who cares? Use a power adapter for your device.If your signal wasn't strong, you would need to increase the headset volume which also increases the level of background hiss. Try it out. I would speculate that a lot of these reviews, which complain of unbearable hissing, are a result of their device's volume level being set low.Hope this info helps. Enjoy the headphones... They're pretty nice.",What do you think about headphone?,[],[],[],[],[]

I bought the Roku 2XS and heavily considered the Apple TV before this one (I have an Iphone and Ipad). I ended up returning the Roku, not ordering the Apple TV and keeping this one. Why? Please read along.FYI, you can jump right into the PROS and CONS if you don't want to see my rationale and comparison of WD to Roku and AppleTVMy decision on buying and keeping the WD was heavily influenced by its claim (and now after trying it for a month, I declare it ""truth"") that it plays any format of video you throw at it. It does. AVI, MKV, MP4, MPEG, anything. You throw it in, it plays to perfection. On comparison, AppleTV barely plays anything non-Apple supported and the Roku was miserable in playing video formats. Other than every other MKV it played NOTHING. Deal breaker.If your main or primary goal is streaming I would suggest the Roku over the WD. Especially if you have Amazon Prime (not supported by WD). It is sleeker, has a much more elegant remote and a smaller box.Coming back the WD: The main function, streaming, works flawlessly in HD setting (at my internet speed of 20MBPs download, 3MBPS upload). Navigation menu is easy to navigate and is well laid out. Not as good as Roku,I might add.Overall it is good but not great and a quick recap as to why is below in the PROS and CONSPROS+ Plays ANYTHING you throw at it via USB+ HD playback is excellent+ You can skip to ""desired time"" as opposed to going with the 2X to 16X forward speed. Sounds trivial but is very helpful when tried+ Has a free remote APP you can download from the APP store (don't know about Android)CONS- No Amazon Prime (I don't get this. Understand AppleTV not offering it but why WD, why?)- Terrible remote like the 1980's VHS player remotes) . You need to push the keys really harr and have close to perfect line of sight to the box- Netflix app asks you to confirm your account every other day. Annoying. Needs an update to fix this.Finally, which player is better fit for who:- WD : If you have multiple formats of videos to watch on your TV and use Netflix, hulu, hulu+ or vudu (plus pandora and a few other music stations) this is for you- Roku : If you want to watch all the mainstream streaming services and Amazon Prime and not care for USB video playback of various video formats, this is for you- AppleTV: If you want to remain in the Apple universe, have an extremely slick gadget (and remote), have the ability to mirror your IPAD or IPhone on your HDTV, and you don't care for Amazon Prime then this is for youOverall, I am very happy with my purchase despite it comes with a remote, that at first look wants you wonder what the heck they were thinking.",What is the quality of support?,['Apple supported and the Roku was miserable in playing video formats'],[689],[1],[1.],[ True]

But is the MP3 player decent or not?  The price really shouldn't matter or decide whether it's good or bad.  And the truth it, it's both.For one, the Rhapsody software it want you to use is junk.  Get rid of it because it doesn't do what it's supposed to and it's clunky, crappy, outdated software.  The way to sync media with this device is with Windows Media Player.  It works best and is the program that makes the most sense.Now to the device.  For one, the buttons are spotty on mine.  Occasionally, the pause button just decides to not work, so I essentially have to shut the thing off at that point.  Which isn't a big deal if you're just listening to songs.  But if you listen to audiobooks or radio shows you've recorded or podcasts, it doesn't ALWAYS save your location on the file.  It usually does, but again, it's spotty and occasionally the device just decides to not save where it was in the file.Another major problem I've had is the battery life.  I'll turn on my device to see it with 50% power.  Then, about 20 minutes later, it shuts off inexplicably and tries to tell me that the battery is empty.  Great.Now this thing is light and I like that.  It clips very comfortably on to your clothes and the clip is sturdy.  So that's one in the plus column.  It's inexpensive but at no point using this device have I forgotten that.  It feels cheap through and through.  And really... it's not all THAT cheap.Otherwise, it does what it's supposed to do.  It plays music files.  You can create custom playlists in WMP or whichever syncing software you choose and it's cool.  Navigating through menus is pretty straight forward.  The sound is decent.Everything about this MP3 player is average at best.  Which isn't necessarily a bad thing.  If you're looking for a solid MP3 player that's light and relatively inexpensive, I personally think you'll be fien here.  It's great for working out and things like that.  I paid nearly $60 for mine and for that price, it does it's job.  Nothing more though.  It doesn't impress me or leave me blown away.

If you're indoors, or shooting at dusk, be prepared to wait up to several seconds for the focus to be set; if it can acquire focus at all.  I find that if I am dealing with dim lit shots of a static subject, manual focus is much more effective.Upon the first use of this lens, I thought something was broken.  This is because the image stabilization makes a light grinding noise.  While the noise can be annoying while taking pictures, it can be catastrophic when recording a video.  Consider that the grinding noise is coming from a lens directly attached to the camera.  This grinding travels very well to the internal microphone, and is forever recorded with your video.As a side note: It would also be nice if Canon started putting their lens caps on leashes.

I went from 7 stations and 15 channels to 17 stations and 43 channels. The furthest is +55 miles. Another is 42 miles... NO problem with either. However most of my stations are with in 22 miles and mostly in one direction. I would say if all your stations are out +40 miles this should work but you might start to thing about an outdoor Bow-Tie antenna. HOWEVER it depends on your house and terrain. If your house is wood, drywall, vinyl siding, with antenna near a second floor window facing toward the station, good to go. If you are in the middle of a brick building, no windows, you can expect less than spectacular performance (I am assuming). OUTDOOR antennas are always better, but I am very impressed. I am an engineer and my hobby is radio and antennas.Since most of my stations I care about are all in one direction I can just set and forget. However if your stations are scattered to the four winds it could be a hassle always having to aim it. Most stations are South East but one is West. It comes in no matter what direction I turn it. It is the strongest station at 17 miles. Two of the distant stations need the antenna to be aimed; they are in different directions and need the antenna to be aimed, but for the most part 90% of my stations are all in one direction.There is no real solution for stations in many directions, even with an outdoor antenna, which would need a ""ROTOR"" to turn it to different direction. With the Terk HDTVa the further out the station the more you have to aim it. This is OK and what gives the antenna it's power and low noise. However it is NOT an omnidirectional antenna. Typically omni directional antennas don't have the performance, as they are a compromise for convenience. You will never get range with an omni direction antenna. Even basic rabbit ears are bi-directional.The two petty gripes others always mention and I will repeat, is the base is narrow so it's tippy side to side. Also because the rabbit ears (the dipole whip antennas) are angled back, you have to give it room, 10"" much more depending on the angle of the base to the wall and how wide you have the whips spread out.",How is the reception?,['I give it 5 stars for indoor antennas'],[0],[1],[0.],[False]

I work from home and run a variety of network intensive tasks, throw in a wife and a Wii and this router has taken care of everything with only a minor quirk or two all year.At home my network consists of CentOS 5.2 servers, a Windows Vista Home Premium Desktop, two Vista laptops (Business and Home Premium), a MacBook, a Windows XP machine, and Virtual Machines up the wazoo.  The 4 ports are full, everything else is run through the wifi including the new Wii.  I port forward HTTP, FTP, SSH, Oracle, and Terminal Services through to statically assigned IP addresses and everything else is making use of the routers DHCP services.  In short -- I think it is getting a pretty good test!Setup was a breeze, but that is standard for Linksys routers I have found.  The instructions were clear and would allow an absolute idiot to set this up although I didn't need them being familiar with their other routers.I live in a largish apartment, and rather than being in a central location the router is squirreled away in the corner office on top of a desktop and below my TV - not ideal I know but the coverage throughout the apartment is always at maximum strength, is as fast as can be expected and I am happy.  I often play online games in my living room on the opposing side of the apartment without problems of laggyness.I first turned on the router in July 2007.  It is now November 2008 and it has been reset maybe four or five times during that period.  Wi-Fi services disappeared forcing me to power off and on again however considering that this is a router based on home usage rather than a fully fledged commercial enterprise I can handle that.  So yes, I don't get my 99.9999% uptime, but I think the five minutes this router has cost me over the last 16 months is rather trivial.",How were the instructions?,['The instructions were clear'],[838],[1],[0.38333333],[False]

It is big enough, but the freedom to arrange the internal space is very limited.The main limit is the fixed divider between the upper and the lower compartments.The upper compartment is just a little too small for another body (Sony A700 with VG or Minolta Maxxum 9 with VG with wide-normal lens).The lower compartment is too big for one body, but a little too small for two bodies.After some tries, I managed to fit two bodies in the lower compartment (although the Velcro is very limited), but then I have no fast access to my equipment and I have to take the bag off to get something out.So I don't really understand this bag - if I want fast access for one body, I'll use a smaller bag. If I am giving up the option for fast access and carry two bodies, I will use backpack which is way more convenient.I feel very frustrated - I like this bag, it is very sturdy and comfortable. It is big and has the potential to be exactly what I am looking for. But it is not...AFTER READING THE COMMENTS TO MY REVIEW:This bag might not be designed to carry two bodies. That's true. But the complain is about the fact that the bag is big and has a lot of space, and yet there is no enough space for a setup I can carry with a much smaller bag. Each photographer has his/her own style and his/her own kit. That's why most of the modern camera bags contains dividers that can be moved around. Before I bought that bag I checked how much space it has and I mistakenly assumed that I will be able to use this space as I wish. That is the usual case with camera bags (at least that is the case with the other Lowepro models I own).In that sense, the older versionLowepro SlingShot 300 All-Weather Camera Bag (Black)is better because you can attach the dividers anywhere in the main compartment.",How is the compartment?,"['The upper compartment is just a little too small for another body (Sony A700 with VG or Minolta Maxxum 9 with VG with wide-normal lens).The lower compartment is too big'

A also have an old Hitachi CRT TV that's rated 720i resolution (a very uncommon thing for a CRT TV.) I bought the E3D420VX and set it side-by-side with each existing TV one at a time. I fed the same signal into both the E3D420VX and one of the old ones simultaneously. I compared the two TVs with standard definition 480i digital (from my satellite box), with 480p from an antenna, and then with 1080i from the antenna. (I don't yet have HD service from my satellite provider.)With both types of signals, the old TVs were both noticeably better than the E3D420VX. The E3D420VX was not as bright, even with the backlight and the brightness turned up to 100%. The colors were not as vivid and not as true as on either of the older sets, regardless of how much I adjusted the color settings. With the 480 signals, the E3D420VX showed a lot of pixellation around the edges of everything in the picture. Even with the 1080i signal, there was a little more pixellation than with the old TVs running at 480i. Finally, the sharpness was noticeably worse on the E3D420VX.One major annoyance was that the E3D420VX takes a long time to come on once the power button is pushed. Perhaps the CCFL backlights need time to warm up??? The VX37L does not have any delay.Finally, I was hoping that with the internet apps, there would be a browser so that I could access general internet features (searches, etc.). But no such luck.I next tried a Vizio E421VO. With the same tests, the results were nearly the same; both the old TVs out-performed the E421VO.I decided to try one more time. So I bought a Vizio M420VT. It's a keeper! The picture is bright, the colors are true, and the 1080i is sharp with no pixellation.

Lost interest in the hobby for a long time, then got back into it in 2009.  Wow, have things changed!  I have been using a Panasonic LX3 since December 2009 with very good results (fast Leica glass on the LX3) and was ready to get back into an interchangeable lens camera.  After doing a lot of hands on research, I decided on the D3100.I've had mine for two weeks now and for the most part, I am impressed.  The D3100 takes excellent images on automatic with the kit lens.  Composition is much easier with a proper viewfinder and the larger sensor makes obtaining shallow depth of field simple.  My semi-pro photographer friends have all commented that my images with the D3100 are more creative, more artistic and much better than with the LX3.Personally, I can see the enhanced creativity in my D3100 images but I feel there is little difference in image quality between the two cameras.  A bit of a disappointment on that regard (I was hoping for sharper images)  but others who have viewed my images disagree with me, so maybe I am being overly critical.  One thing I have discovered is the D3100's abilities far exceed mine when I take it off automatic - in other words, there is a steep learning curve going manual on this camera.  I have a lot to learn about exposure so I feel that the D3100 will be a great tool to help me enhance my photographic skills.I am a bit disappointed in the build quality - the SD card door is flimsy and moves around a bit when closed, the lens creaks.  The all metal LX3 has much better build quality than the D3100.  To be fair, the D3100 has better build quality than the Canons I tested.The D3100 feels great in my hands and is very nice to use.  The ergonomics are perfect.  I tested the D5100 and the D90 as well as all the Canon Rebels.  Of all of them, the D3100 felt the best.I considered getting the D5100 for its better sensor and screen, but the actual real world price difference was $400  (D5100 was being sold above sticker, D3100 was sold to me with a $100 Nikon rebate and an additional 10% discount from the retailer) and that was a significant savings.The 230k screen is adequate, not great, but acceptable.Overall, I am pleased.  I am looking forward to learning how to get the most out of this camera and I definitely feel it will help me grow as a photographer.Update, 6/1/11:  After reading Bryan Peterson's ""Understanding Exposure"", I am now shooting on full manual controls with my D3100.  I set shutter speed, aperture, ISO and white balance for every shot.  I also purchased the superb Nikkor 35mm f1.8 prime lens and a Tamron 70-300 telephoto zoom lens.  With my newly acquired knowledge about setting exposure, the images I am taking with the D3100 are excellent.  Images taken with the prime lens are tack sharp, that lens is amazing.  The Tamron set to 70 mm also takes sharp images (images taken with the Tamron at 70 mm are sharper than the kit lens and the Tamron does not get soft until 300mm).  With just a little post processing (I am using the View NX software that came with the camera), I can get the images from the kit lens to look incredible.  I am extremely satisfied with this camera and I highly recommend it.",What is the best instruments to take a good image ?,['The D3100'],[484],[2],[0.],[False]

I have two other Canon IS USM lenses, a 17-55 f2.8 and a 70-300 f4-f5.6.  I bought this lens to fill the gap between the two.I haven't had this new lens very long, but here are my initial impressions...  First, it's shorter (when zoomed out), lighter and smaller in diameter than the 17-55 f2.8 lens that was previously our typical carry-around lens.  Obviously, it doesn't work as well in low light as the f2.8 lens, but that's to be expected.  Still, it takes very nice pictures, and doesn't seem too limited by the smaller aperture.  The colors seem accurate, and the IS seems to work very well.The barrel doesn't rotate, either when zooming or focusing, so it is possible to use filters that rely on a fixed orientation.  This is not the case with my 70-300mm zoom...that lens rotates as it focuses.  Though it isn't a big deal to me, others might be more concerned with this.My only complaint with this lens is that, unlike my other two Canon IS USM zoom lenses, it will extend under it's own weight when the camera is facing down.  And there is no lock (again, unlike my other two lenses) to keep it in it's shortest length during transport.  This annoys me when I'm carrying the camera.Comparing pictures taken with this lens to those taken with my 70-300 lens (at 70 and 135...the widest two lengths common to both lenses)...this lens seemed to have slightly more vivid colors, and a wider DOF.  The depth of field was to be expected, I'd think, given the shorter lens and slightly larger aperture.  The more vivid colors, I guess, could be explained the same way, though the difference was very small.  Both lenses produced very nice results, IMO.My lens was a white-box lens...which was not mentioned in the product description.  I half-expected this, given that the price I paid was low...lower even than the current prime price shown on Amazon for this item.  But I would like to have seen the item description accurately state this up front.  The lens came wrapped in a single layer of bubble-wrap inside a plain white cardboard box.  This was, in turn, shipped inside a slightly larger box and padded with packing paper.  There was no documentation or software included (save for the warranty card, which WAS included), as you'd get with a lens sold in retail packaging...so be aware that this is the case.  Nonetheless, my lens arrived quickly, and intact.  My order was fulfilled by ALLTIMEDEALS.",How is the contrast?,[],[],[],[],[]

Even though I can only get data from my broadband router just so fast, the router seems to be effortlessly routing everything in my network without any slowdowns.  Unfortunately, I didn't get any range improvement in one area of my house and my main laptop is still around -60db (and about 1 MB/s)  I was hoping to get a little more but the faster router processor seems to keep the data flowing very steadily.

If I got further than 30 feet from the router and had any obstructions, the signal was just about useless.  I was -90db at 40 feet thru one wall and the ROKU XR failed to hook up.  I eventually just turned the 5ghz radio off on the router.One other thing I like is a guest network feature.

I had to call tech support. Thankfully the woman was incredibly helpful. She walked me through switching my router's security type to WPA and then the set up for the Almond Securifi was a breeze. So if you've got a newer main router to begin with, or at least one not using outdated security types, you'll probably just plug it in, click on the signal from your current router in the list, enter your router password, then wait 30 seconds for the Almond to do the rest. You'll then see a graphic showing the connection and can just direct your devices to the new signal instead of the old one. She was also going to show me how to merge the listings for the two signals, so that only one would show instead of ABC and ABC_almond, but I actually prefer seeing the two separate.I love that you can visually see the connection, and that each morning when I plug both devices in again, since I unplug both devices overnight (don't want to expose myself to more electromagnetics than necessary), within just seconds it finds all its settings and there are those green visuals showing the connection again. No need to reconfigure anything.It's also quite small and sleek looking, so not an eyesore in the middle of the kitchen (the halfway point in my house).  I like it so much that when I decide to retire my old router I will definitely be getting a second one of these. It's signal is also not quite strong enough to cover my entire property with just one (has range of 100 ft), but with two of them I'll be in great shape.Special bonus, if you are a T-mobile cell user, you already know you can use your wifi connection to make calls and send texts/surf the web. So extending your wifi range to all of your property, not just where your computer is, will be even more worthwhile.  Just be sure to unplug all this wireless stuff when everyone goes to bed at night if you're going to amp up the coverage so that it's hitting the bedrooms too. You'll sleep better.

I'll 'pause' the audio for whatever reason and then restart it with 'play' (both on the headset) and every once in a while some other audio will start playing -- like instead of continuing the podcast, some other podcast or some song will start.  I'm guessing this is some setting in Android, but I don't really know, and when it happens I'll have to pull over and take the phone out and find right app and find the thing I was listening to again, and get that playing again.  I haven't figured out if the headset is sending sloppy button signals, or the phone is just timing out, or what's going on.  It happens maybe 1 out of 10 times.  The Backbeat has the same problem (actually, worse).My last headset had microphone noise suppression for calls (I think it had two mics and did waveform subtraction) and I could talk to people in full wind or street noise and they didn't even know I was outside.  This mic doesn't have that, and people on calls with me always complain about the wind noise, so I have to slow way down or stop and walk.This is still a fantastic headset, and at a great price ($45).  If they would add microphone noise suppression like my other one, I would happily pay double for this.  Aside from that, this is still a fantastic headset.One other thought: this headset has the plug-in (to the ear) ear buds that form an air-tight seal.  Around the office I prefer the Backbeats because they sit in the ear and don't make the air-tight seal, so I can hear the office noises and people better.

This is my first dSLR camera and I might as well have never been taking pictures when I had my point-and-shoot.  I wanted a camera that was capable of actually taking useable pictures indoors and also have a touch of zoom on it.  This does both great.  I can't believe the quality and clarity indoors, even at night.  With hardly any lights on it can take crisp photos with ease.  I was able to zoom across a dimly lit 40-foot room, use the flash, and read the serial numbers off my camera's box!  Amazing.The standard flash seems to work pretty well.  I'll probably get an external flash eventually, but the one it comes with works great.  Seems to be pretty powerful.  I haven't tested it outside at night yet, though.I've only played with the video capabilities briefly.  You set it up by finding your focus point and then roll from there.  It keeps the focus well and only small adjustments are needed when depth in your focused subject changes.  Might take a little work knowing when and how to change the focus during some action shots but eventually the non-autofocus throughout the video could end up being a positive rather than a negative due to customizing capabilities.The camera seems solid, but very light.  I couldn't believe the difference between this camera and my dad's 60D (which had a smaller lens on his as well).  It seems significantly lighter.  I thought this was a great feature since I'll probably use the camera a lot on the go.The functions of the camera make sense.  While I'm just a beginner, there seems to be a lot of room to learn with the camera.  The ease of use is easy enough for my wife to follow without having to learn all the intricacies to shooting a manual shot.  Yet all the manual capabilities are there when you want it.The live view screen is large, bright, and crisp.  Very easy to read in any light setting.Overall, I LOVE the camera.  While I would probably love any dSLR just coming from a point-and-shoot, the features of this camera are what attracted me to it.  It is light, powerful, and easy to use with flexibility to grow.

The 26 was fine but the 32 main board had a blown resistor as well. Samsung will only fix the capacitors and not anything that may happen to the LCD due to cascade failure! Anyhow the price to fix the 32 was close to $300! So for a bit more we bought the 40 with Smart TV.We had tried the better Samsung 40 LED with 3D and faster processor in the past but found the picture with the faster processing to be fake looking and would turn that feature off. The 3D worked but we felt it would be best for a larger TV and will consider it when we replace our Pioneer Elite 60 Plasma. Hopefully not for a long time Just Love that TV and wish Pioneer had stayed in the game.As many reviewers have stated; and it is the case with most slim LEC/LED's with the speakers in the back; the sound can be low at times. We have adjusted the settings for clear voice. It seems that conversation is the first to be effected and the sound can be too low to hear. We always have the remote in the ready to turn the volume up and rewind to hear what we missed. Sure you could turn the volume up; and we have; but it becomes too loud.It took a bit but I finally got the screen / color settings to our liking. Our set had a push to the red side and flesh tone was off most of the time. Even now it will shift from time to time. One second the flesh tone will seem fine and the next it looks like everyone has a tan or slight sun burn. Not sure if this is due to the background colors present. Another item is the off screen angle doesn't seem to be as good as the higher level sets. Colors and settings are a personal choice and some might light the all the settings on and the picture really bright. I prefer the subtle approach and will turn most settings down. If you turn on the Black enhancement features to full you will crush you your shadows and details. I found there to be enough settings to make the adjustments that were needed. Also this is a 60Hz set with 1080p. Don't let the 60Hz scare you or be fooled into needed the 240Hz. The picture is great and as stated before we found the higher speed sets to look fake. Almost like watching a live play.The Smart TV works great for us. We have it connected via a hard connection and are not using the wireless. Having the wireless is a Great feature but a hard connection is always best if you can. The update has added Amazon Prime to the menu which is something we were looking for. We were using our PS3 to connect to Amazon Prime and now only use the Samsung to do so. Amazon Prime has quit a bit of children programing and my son loves Thomas the Train.The remote has all the functions you will need and lights up! It also controls our PS3 if we watch a Blu Ray!The downside. This TV doesn't have a swivel stand! Out 32 Samsung did and we need this feature so everyone can see the set. Also with the weaker off angle on this set it is needed to direct to the screen to the viewing area. This is mainly need for us because we have the TV in the corner. If you had the set straight it would be fine. We bought this TV Swivel at Amazon that works great -B009UDTUNGA minor but weak area is the cable retainer. It does not stick to the stand! The stand has a small area that is not flat to attach the retainer to but the double sided tape to hold the cable retainer to the set keeps falling off. The cable retainer held firmly on one older 26 and 32 Samsungs.For the price it is the perfect set for our living room. We use the Pioneer for our home theater setup.

Great concept and can save you hundreds on Cable TV bills, but most recent changes basically broke the product, which used to be a more reliable device and better value for your money.--The positive--If you are into movies, already have a Netflix or you're an Amazon Prime subscriber and you don't have any game console at home, this is a great little device.

The company also states it uses less power than previous model, but I honestly do not think that you will save thousands of dollars anyway; the biggest savings come from dropping your Cable TV service altogether.--The not so nice and what changed --Here's are the bad news. The firmware and software is buggy. I was watching Amazon on demand and the stuff restart twice. It happened several times and continue to happen, even after firmware upgrade. Something similar with Netflix. The ""supported"" channels take an eternity to load, like CNN. I understand that this device is basically a ""man in the middle"", just streaming the online content to your TV, but the previous model was much more stable (I sold it to get this one)But, If you are more into TV shows or live news, you are out of luck with Roku 2. Most of the unofficial channels do not work anymore: PlayOn, Plex, NokNok. Those basically allow  you to watch local USA TV or CBS on your TV, via Roku. They were working on the previous model, for some weird reason (copyright issues or software problems) they no longer work on this one and no ETA of when is going to be fixed, maybe never, who knows.So in a nutshell. You will loose the capability of watch those unofficial channels I mentioned, some ports were removed, the box is smaller and uses less power, and gives you a higher resolution for some movies or show. Worth the money? I don't think so. You can do exactly the same (with the exception of games and getting a higher resolution) with the Roku 1. Hence, I don't see a reason to upgrade or buy the new one.This is a nice product but it is too buggy or the company started to loss its battle against major TV stations.By the way, I currently have a 12Mbps Internet connection. Not a T1 or Fiber Optic, but more than enough to handle HD video streamingBuy the previous model instead and enjoy while it last ... it is a shame that USA users are condemned to pay higher bills if we want live TV and good programming...** EDIT ***8/16/2011Bought the previous model again, which I sold by mistake. Run the setup, added PlayOn, it works!!! Time to sell Roku 2.People, this is one of those cases where new does not mean better or faster. Just one more comment, we can still have or get 1024 dpi resolution on previous model. Also, most channels are not providing anything higher than 740, so even in resolution you're not going to lose anything if you buy the previous model instead.I would probably take a look on Roku 2 on 6 months or so, when it gets a more stable firmware and patches.For those interested: my PlayOn runs on a Mac mini 2010. The Mac Mini has 8GB of RAM and I assigned 2GB to the virtual machine. The virtual machine runs Windows XP SP3 and the virtualization software is Parallels. I tried Virtual box but does not provide the performance PLayOn needs.",Why the performance of this lens is very poor?,[],[],[],[],[]

Being new to the DSLR game, the ""philosophy"" of 4/3s seemed very sound to me; high quality lenses that are compact and can be coupled with compact bodies that will put out excellent image quality; of course the added benefit of in-body stabilisation seemed to just make a great sum of parts. I went through a range of 4/3s bodies including theOlympus Evolt E-3and while I was always pleased with the lenses, the image quality always left more to be desired. Also, once I switched to the E-3, the bulk of the system didn't make sense to me as it was pretty similar to full frame and yet lagged in image quality. After 2 years with 4/3s I finally moved on to theNikon D700and have been with it ever since.The caveat of full-frame is obviously the inherent size and weight of the system and I hated being ""the camera guy"" every time I was out with friends or even shooting casually and that's when I started dabbling with micro 4/3s. The initial iterations while exciting, still were slow and not great in terms of IQ, but the E-M5 changed it all. Over the years the system has matured and the E-M5 finally brings a good quality semi-pro body that is small, light, beautiful and most importantly excels in image quality. I use this camera with Panasonic lenses,Panasonic 12-35mm/F2.8,Panasonic 7-14mm f/4.0&Panasonic 25mm f/1.4 Leica Lensand this entire system fits neatly in a shoulder bag with 3 batteries.I've been shooting with this system for 3 months now and have found the image quality to be very similar to my D700. I still use my D700 for paid work because I'm used to it, but I don't see why the E-M5 wouldn't work for anyone that wants to use it professionally. Of course, the depth of field differences will always exist, but those are inherent characteristics of the systems and it's up to the user to make the best or worst of it.Overall, the E-M5 finally realises what 4/3s was supposed to be and I recommend this camera very highly for anyone that's either looking to enter into a camera system or wants to supplement a full frame system with something smaller and lighter. But of course, there are a few compromises, but none that should be detrimental to use. I also like the new stabilisation system which has allowed me to get tack sharp shots at up to 1s of exposure! Also, the weather sealed body makes a huge difference too.This camera is a definite winner.",Is this lens have manual focus?,['high quality lenses that are compact and can be coupled with compact bodies that will put out excellent image quality'],[214],[1],[0.77],[ True]

One of our dogs got tangled in the mouse cord and subsequently disconnected the internal wiring. Had a computer repair shop look at it but he couldn't repair it so I went online to buy a new one. I couldn't believe the $200-$400 asking prices for the discontinued trackball. Enter Amazon.After reading reviews on this product I was concerned about driver installation, but decided to give it a shot for $40. So happy I did. Installation was quick and flawless. Simply plug in the USB receiver and the mouse was recognized fairly quickly, although it took about 4-5 minutes before the mouse would actually function. I currently use a Toshiba L675 laptop with 64 bit Vista OS.

The design is almost as the same, just the power switch and the mode dial exchanged their places. One significant addition - a GPS mark on the top, right above the lens. The blue color is not that dark as on TZ5 and not so striking bright as on ZR1. A slight dent on the back with some prominence on the right side makes a very convenient grip to operate with one hand. A metal body looks pretty solid, however it is not that heavy.PERFORMANCE: The new camera has a pretty good performance: the startup time is a little bit more than 1 sec and with almost zero shutter lag. Taking into account a new very quick ""Sonic Speed"" auto focus, which takes about 0.35-0.4 sec, you will be able to catch virtually every spur-of-the-moment photo. And a dedicated movie button allows starting video recording at any time without any preparation.LENS: Leica lens is just excellent: unusually big for a so small body 12x zoom starting with the very convenient for indoors shooting 25mm up to telephoto 300mm (equiv.) plus a quick and precise auto focus (however might be somewhat slower in low-light), and good optical image stabilization in conjunction with the digital one which allows you to take sharp pictures in the entire zoom range and at the very low shutter speed around 1/8 and even 1/4. The auto-focusing and optical image stabilization work in absolute silence, and the only zooming produces some soft ""sh-sh-sh"" noise. Good news - without any start/stop clicks on the footage :).DISPLAY: A large 3-inch high-resolution LCD monitor with 460K pixels has a very good contrast and saturation - the pictures look very ""juicy"". The brightness also is high enough to be seen even in a direct sun-light (just a bit darker) and in a wide angle of view. All that allows to share photos and videos immediately with other people.MENU: For those who used the Panasonic P&S; cameras before the ZS7 menu looks very familiar, just some new items added. Also there is a Quick-Menu button which is very helpful for a quick access to the most frequently used settings. The new camera has such a luxury as the Aperture, Shutter speed, and Manual modes and there is a new Exposure button (next to the video one) which allows to set manually the aperture using the Left-Right buttons and the shutter speed with Up-Down buttons.AUTO SETTINGS: The best in the industry Panasonic's Intelligent Auto mode is getting better with each new model. Actually it's a whole bunch of sophisticated algorithms which help to take really nice pictures with minimum efforts. They are worth to be aware about so here is a brief list of most effective of them.""Intelligent Scene Selector"" - It quickly analyzes the light conditions as well as focusing results and selects either portrait, scenery, macro, night portrait or night scenery. It also displays a small icon of the chosen scene in the top left corner. The feature is extremely helpful when you need to shoot very fast on spur-of-the-moment.""Intelligent ISO"" - If camera detects that your subject is moving, it raises ISO and shutter speed to take shots without motion blur, otherwise it will try to keep the lowest possible ISO to reduce noise and to get nice clear pictures.""Intelligent Exposure"" - it's a kind of a small brother of the High Dynamic Range feature. If the camera sets the correct overall exposure but some areas happen to be too dark, this feature automatically increases the brightness of the dark areas to make the entire picture to look more balanced. It also pretty effective for the backlight conditions - instead of getting just a silhouette of your subject against the bright sky it makes the subject normally exposed but without washing out the nice blue sky.""Face Detection"" - is another great thing for taking good-quality pictures of people. It happened to me a number of times in the past that a presence in the frame of a more contrast element somewhere behind the person I'm taking picture of was making the camera to adjust focus at that unimportant distant object and therefore made the major person out-of-focus. The same way if there is a bright background behind the person then the camera will measure the luminance of that background while the person's image will be pretty much underexposed (dark). The Face Detection feature identifies the human faces and tells the camera to adjust focus and exposure for the faces first so the people on the picture will be looking well exposed, clear and sharp.ADVANCED FEATURES: I guess the most interesting and advanced is a new ""Intelligent Resolution"" feature. Actually it combines a sophisticated noise reduction with a new picture enhancement algorithm. This feature automatically identifies the 3 type of the picture areas: outlines, detailed textures, and smooth gradation panes and provides an optimized handling for each of them separately. As a result the photo looks sharper at the edges and more clean in between. Many old P&S; cameras had pretty fast picture quality degradation at the ISO around 300-400 and higher. The shots taken by ZS7 even at ISO 400 look pretty good on the small and even medium-size prints.IMAGE QUALITY: Imagine on a sunny day you take an outdoors picture of a wall made of the new brown bricks with a $3000 DSLR and a small P&S; camera from the distance about 6-8 feet. How could you recognize by which camera was taken a certain shot? The subject is plain so no Depth-of-Field is involved into comparison. However in this example the two characteristics will help to distinct the cameras: 1) The edges of bricks will be well outlined on DSLR shots and a kind of fuzzy on the P&S; ones; 2) The new bricks do not have any structure on their sides, they are just plane and so exactly that way they will look on the DSLR shots, while on the P&S; ones their sides will show more or less amount of noise. If you perform the same test for an evenly cut line of bushes (again DOF is not involved) you will see the same result plus the internal structure of each leaf will be more clear on the DSLR photos. So to make pictures taken with your P&S; camera looking like the DSLR ones the P&S; camera should make the outlines sharper, clean the noise on the plane or soft gradation areas, and slightly emphasize the internal structures, if any. That is exactly what the new ""Intelligent Resolution"" (IR) feature tries to do.The ""iAuto"" mode in ZS7 is organized the way that you will have decent, good photos in virtually any situation right out-of-the-box. The several hundreds shots I took by now look good on my 24"" display and so they will on the similar size prints. But if you look at them at 100% crop (magnification) then on many of them you might find some areas which do not look natural. If the IR-algorithm decides about a certain low-contrast part on your picture that it's a plane area then it will remove all the noise altogether with all the subtle details from that part of the picture. If you take a picture of a big tree with hundreds of branches (but without leaves) against a bright sky the IR-feature will treat it as a structured area and will slightly sharpen it to look clearer. But when you take a landscape picture with many distant trees in front and behind, those hundreds of crossing branches will create a low-contrast pattern which together with internal sensor's noise might look for IR-algorithm as just a noisy plain area and so it will obliterate all the details leaving only some average color in that part of the picture and so making it looking very unnatural. The thing is that unlike the previous models the noise reduction in ZS7 is pretty strong. I would not call it ""aggressive"" but it's really strong.QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS: There is a way how to get the best out of this camera while shooting landscapes on sunny days. Here is a recipe for experienced amateurs:- Switch the mode dial to the program ""P"" mode.- Press the Menu button and select the lowest ISO 80 instead of ""Auto"" (this is the key-point! If there is no enough light to set that low ISO it will not work).- Make sure you have the ""Intelligent Resolution"" feature on!- Find on the 4th page of the shooting menu the item ""PICT.ADJ."" and press the right button to go inside. You will see the 4 pictures attributes:CONTRASTSHARPNESSSATURATIONNOISE REDUCTION- A default value for each of them is ""0"". Set ""-1"" for contrast (to reduce the clipping of highlights), ""+1"" for sharpness, leave the saturation unchanged, and most important set noise reduction to ""-1"" or even to its minimum ""-2"". Take this advice as a starting point and try to play with the SHARPNESS and NOISE REDUCTION settings and see what looks more appropriate for you, because some people prefer more sharpness while the others are more concern about noise visibility, so try different settings and choose which one looks better for you.Those settings will allow you to take the most sharp and detailed pictures of landscapes, architecture, etc. if you like that. However you should be alert and check periodically the quality of pictures and if something is going wrong then switch immediately to ""iAuto"" mode. The ZS7's intelligent auto-mode is very sophisticated and might take into account the parameters you're not even aware about. For example, if you apply the full zoom then the aperture drops to a small F/4.9 value giving much less light for the sensor and additionally at that huge focal length 300mm (equiv.) the impact of your shaking hands might be as so much that the optical image stabilization can not completely compensate it and so the camera will have to increase the shutter speed to have the picture un-blurred. In that tough scenario the only high ISO around 300-400 might satisfy all those conditions and the camera will normally set it in auto-mode. But if you keep shooting recklessly at ISO 80 without getting the feedback such kind of pictures might be spoiled in some way. So, use this recipe only if you know what you're doing.Update: Having using ZS7 for a while I've identified the 3 major types of pictures depending what is most important for you on those shots: 1) The main part are the areas with soft gradations like human faces, petals of flowers on macro shots, etc; 2) Mixed content of plain areas and patterns with no central subject; 3) Landscapes with plenty of trees, branches and leaves or small flowers. The above proposed recipe is most effective for the last category - it will give you the sharpest pictures with no low-contrast areas smeared by the strong noise reduction and on the other hand the higher level of noise will be effectively hidden by the complex image structure. For the 2nd category it would be wiser to decrease noise reduction just to -1 (not -2) to make the noise less visible on some plain areas, and for the 1st category it seems better to keep the default neutral setting since to have less noise on the human's face is much more important than lack of minor details around. Anyway you'll still have the advantage of less noise at minimum ISO.I did some comparative testing of ZS7 with my Nikon D90 to find out how much that new IR technology and the above mentioned recommendations could help to improve the overall picture quality. I've uploaded some pictures and put a link into my comments dated 04/24/2010 with the title ""Compare to Nikon D90"". Don't assume, just take a look - you might be a bit surprised :-)LOW LIGHT: Recently I performed a brief comparative test of my P&S; cameras: Panasonic ZS7 and Sony TX7. Shortly - their low-light performance (in normal mode) is very similar. The medium-size 8""x10"" prints without much cropping look good up to ISO 400. At ISO 800 there is a noticeable drop of the image quality of both cameras and at 1600 the shots look decent only for 4""x6"" prints. Generally the Sony TX7's shots look smoother because of more aggressive noise reduction while the Panasonic ZS7's ones display slightly more details along with a little bit more noise. So it's the matter of taste to decide which shots look better. I would admit that at ISO 1600 while the Panasonic's shots became much more blurred because of the increased noise reduction strength, the Sony's shots became poured with much coarse noise which got even stronger at ISO 3200 making the pictures completely unusable. So neither of these cameras could be considered as great low-light performers.In case when the shots become too dark because of big lack of light you can select the ""HIGH SENS."" (sensitivity) scene. The camera will automatically choose a high ISO in the range 1600 - 6400 and decrease resolution to 3MP (it was stated 3200-6400 but in some tests my camera set ISO 1600). It will not provide better quality but at least will allow to increase the picture's brightness.NOTE! This camera is great outdoors, but if many of your pictures are indoors or in low-light environment then you'd better look for some other cameras like Panasonic LX5/LX3 or GF1, Canon S95/S90 or G12/G11, Fujifilm F80EXR, etc. which were designed especially for those conditions. The original model name of this camera is ""TZ"" which stands for ""Travel Zoom"" i.e. it was designed for travel outdoors, not for indoors.DYNAMIC RANGE: means the difference between the most light and dark areas on the picture. If you're taking the shots of your friends on a sunny day with a bright blue sky above and some bushes with green leaves aside and those bushes happen to be in the shadow of a nearby building then the difference between brightness of the sky and the bushes will be thousands of times. On the shots taken by a camera with narrow dynamic range only one element - your friends might look good, but the sky will be completely washed out to white and the bushes will be almost black. For the cameras with a decent DR like ZS7 at least two elements of that picture will look good i.e. either your friends with a nice blue sky while the bushes will be very dark, or the friends and bushes good but the sky pretty much wiped out. The new Panasonic ZS7 has the two solutions to help in such situations: the ""Intelligent Exposure"" feature and the ""High Dynamic (range)"" scene.Although both solutions aim at the same goal they work in a different way and should be used in different situations. The ""Intelligent Exposure"" feature once it is activated via the main or quick menu puts its white icon to the lower left corner and starts constantly analyzing the picture. If the difference in brightness of some significant areas of the picture exceeds a certain threshold then the icon becomes yellow and that feature decreases the overall contrast of the picture. Since that threshold is very high that feature would be mostly useful on the bright sunny days. Its effectiveness is not that big but it still can be helpful and anyway it's better than nothing so you can have it turned on all the time. The ""High Dynamic"" scene should be used only in low light conditions because even in a bright sun it will unconditionally set ISO 400 (or even higher) and decrease the shutter speed. Such a high ISO will greatly increase the amount of noise and therefore will cause a more aggressive noise reduction which will actively obliterate small details. That scene provides much more effective dynamic range compression but at the cost of significantly decreased picture quality. If you're shooting in a low-light condition you have nothing to loose, but if you're taking pictures on a nice day with a plenty of sunshine the loss of quality might greatly disappoint you, so that scene should be used only for the low-light shooting.MOVIE MODE: By now I tried only the advanced AVCHD movie mode - it looked very well. Apart from the processing the still images in this model Panasonic applied their new ""Intelligent Resolution"" feature to video recording as well and the result is just gorgeous!

It was definitely worth it.  The player is light and easy to connect, so I can move it easily and quickly.

You can play word games, watch a whole bunch of different TVapps and even turn your TV into a virtual fire place. I cancelled my cable about a year ago because of the monthly cost and have been relying on Netflix and Amazon, so having these extra shows to check out was really exciting.

There is also a front flap that's not sealed, so if you're caught in the rain that compartment will get water in it.Overall, I wasn't clear on who they designed this for.

I decided on Canon because I had one years ago and really liked it.  The quality seems to have gone downhill. The best feature is the compact size.  I find the ""smart auto"" not to be so smart.  The images are usually over-exposed and at times out of focus.  It's as if the camera can't figure out what I want to photograph and instead picks some detail I'm not interested in.  The menus are not obvious and I have to keep running to the computer to read the manual, which is not very handy if I'm away from the computer.  I got this to replace an old HP digital camera that took great photos.  The image quality of the Canon is much worse.  I suspect that the HP had a much better quality lens.  The battery needs to be recharged after about 170 photos.  I haven't tried the video yet, but I suspect that will shorten the battery life even more.  I was used to taking 250-300 photos with my previous camera before changing the battery.  I read some reviews that said not to even bother with the smart auto mode and I think they are right.  I need to experiment with the ""P"" mode to see if I can get some decent photos with this camera.  I had considered getting a cheaper model of the Canon powershot camera but opted for this more expensive one because of the extra feature.  I think the extra money was not well spent since the Canon ELPH 300 performs about as well as a camera costing half as much.  To be fair, I've only had the camera a week and there is a steep learning curve.  If things improve over the next few weeks, I'll add an update and may give this camera a higher rating.  At this time I'm feeling disappointed.Addendum (6/5/11): I've now had several more days to play with the camera and after trying all kinds of settings the picture quality is not much better.  I finally made some videos, which looked nice, but the microphones picked up a lot of extraneous noise even indoors in a quiet room and introduced a kind of background hum into the audio.  If the quality of sound doesn't matter to you, the videos are quite nice.  I've decided to keep the camera because it's so compact and I plan to take it on trips.  The photos are passable but nothing spectacular.  The problems with focusing and overexposure have continued.  I think the lens is just not as good quality as in previous cameras I've owned, including an old Canon.  Maybe the fault lies in me since I'm not an expert on photography. A friend who is a serious photographer offered to go over the camera with me, so after we get together I'll have a better idea.Addendum (6/24/11):  I had this camera for over 3 weeks now and have taken hundreds of photos with it.  My original impression has not changed.  It takes decent photos in general.  The AUTO feature is useless and needs to be avoided outdoors because it totally over-exposes the photos.  It's kind of ludicrous that you can't use the AUTO feature outdoors on a point and shoot camera.  Indoors the AUTO function is acceptable.  The Programable mode does a better job, and it's all that I use now.  Generally I'm disappointed with the quality of the images and It think this has to do with the cheap lens this camera uses.  As I said previously, it is nowhere near the quality of previous Canon cameras I have owned.  The best feature is the small size of the camera, so I will be keeping it and using it on vacations because it is so portable.",Do you know film a video?,['the computer'],[565],[1],[0.],[False]

It is very simple to pair it with the iPad.  While designed for iPad, it also works with iPhones and computers.The keyboard charges via micro-usb.  It does not take long to charge and the battery lasts a very long time.The new Airbender 2.0 also has a nice new design that allows the iPad stand to be removed from the keyboard and stand alone.  This allows you to set it up similar to a separate keyboard and monitor like you would have with your computer.

I bought 3 of these drives mainly because I was getting tired of using external hard drives that required their own power supply, and like the idea of a portable, USB powered backup.I've had WD drives before and not experienced any issues with them (I've got a couple of their 'powered' drives).  But these little buggers have been frustrating!ALL 3 WORK independently.  No issues there.  The trouble begins when you try to daisy chain and use more than one at a time!  A single 2TB drive was not going to be enough, so the plan was to link these together using a powered hub.My system:  HP 19"" laptop, running windows 7, 64 bit.  4 GB RAMHow I prepared and set up the drives:1 - The drives are ready to go out of the box.  The cables that come with them are PATHETICALLY SHORT.  About a foot long.2 - For each drive, I plugged them in one at a time and went into the properties to give them a unique drive name as to not confuse the computer, and keep them straight in windows explorer.  To keep it easy, I named them ""My Passport 1"", ""My Passport 2"", and ""My Passport 3"".  (I get the same problem I am about to describe if I have spaces in the name, or not)3 - To link them together, I made use of the following:a - HDE 2 Port USB 3.0 54mm Express CardB0046XUMDWb - Anker USB 3.0 7-Port Hub with 36W Power AdapterB006TT91TWc - AmazonBasics USB 3.0 A-Male to A-Female Extension CableB008EQYRRY4 - I tested the cable (3c Above) first by plugging each drive into the female end, and the male end into the express card (3a above).  the drive spun up, computer recognized it with no issues.  All 3 drives checked out OK.5 - I then tested the powered hub (3b above).  Plugged it into the Express Card (3a above) directly, the other end into an outlet.  I plugged in each drive one at a time (tested individually)... no issues.  all drives recognized.6 - next, I tested the hub WITH the cable.  I plugged the cable (3c) into the express card (3a), then the Hub (3b) into the cable (3c), AC adapter into the outlet.  The PC recognized the hub with no issues.This is where it gets puzzling:7 - I plugged ""My Passport 1"" into the Hub (3b).  Little blue light on the hub came on.  The hard drive started to flicker, computer made the 'discovery' sound, and windows explorer opened showing the new drive, and it appeared as 'My Passport 1"" in the directory tree.  could access the drive with no issues.8 - I plugged ""My Passport 2"" into the Hub (3b).  Little blue light on the hub came on.  The hard drive started to flicker, computer made the 'discovery' sound, and windows explorer opened showing the new drive, and it appeared as 'My Passport 2"" in the directory tree.  could access the drive with no issues.9 - I plugged ""My Passport 3"" into the Hub (3b).  Little blue light on the hub came on.  The hard drive started to flicker, computer made the 'discovery' sound, AND THAT WAS IT.  windows explorer would not see the 3rd drive, yet the computer must, because you get the audio tone as you did with the first 2.  I clicked on the properties for the drivers; on 'manage'; checked in 'device manager' - no way on earth to get to the 3rd drive.  yet you can pick it up and feel it is running.I installed the software that came with the hub, rebooted after installing each drive, nothing seems to work.10 - I ruled out a bad drive by repeating the procedures above, but changing the order of the drives being connected to the hub.  I started with 'my passport 3' - fired up, recognized no problems (yet in #9 - the computer would see it based on the sound, but that was it).  plugged in 'my passport 1'.  it also fired up, computer recognized - windows explorer opened - good to go.  plugged 'my passport 2' into the hub, behavior was similar to #9.things I have not tried yet:  2 drives in the Express card and one drive into the onboard USB2 port, but what sense would THAT make?  all 3 USB 3.0 drives will boot individually with the hub, but no more than 2 of them.ANYONE else had this problem or have a solution?  you should be able to plug all 3 drives into the 7 port hub with no issues.  I can plug 2 drives into the hub, and then plug an older USB 2.0 drive into the hub, 2 thumbnail drives - all work in harmony.  but 3 WD 2TB drives?  haven't figured that one out yet",What about cable ?,[],[],[],[],[]

The ""small"" cover/grip is nice and flat on the sides with a small footprint.  99% of the other gaming mice out there have a huge palm-grip design with all these crazy grooves for your thumb, long enough to rest your whole hand on, etc.  If that's the kind of mouse you like, then this might not be for you as even the ""large"" cover/grip is really only slightly larger than the ""small"" grip.

Well the weights are in the back/rear side of the mouse, so when I pick up the mouse it tilts/pivots back a little which DOES move the cursor initially.  Used to the 50/50 weight distribution and possibly mice not SO sensitive!  Maybe I need to play with the weights a lil more, play with my grip, or just remove them entirely (which is a shame as it takes that feature of the mouse away).

Now to those who say one cannot compare a prime to a zoom, I say: why not? Aren't we discussing image quality or are we discussing something else?Given the very large images produced by modern DSLRs, I can crop the image from this 50mm and get the zoom effect I need given the minimum zoom of 50mm (times crop factor). I can also place this lens on my Elan 7 film camera and get spectacular results. I use this lens more and more and zoom using my physical zoom (feet) and digital zoom (Photoshop or Aperture or any image editing software). The results are always great. No, I cannot print to 40x60 inches if I crop from this lens, but I am not planning to do that anyway.When I shoot a wedding (not bridal portraits, I use the 85mm prime for that) the photos made using this lens are always the best and always the favorites. I know it does not have the little red ring around it but that is just to show other photographers that you are hip and with it, not necessarily to get better images and certainly not based on the money-to-image-quality ratio. Nope, buying a more expensive camera or a more expensive lens will NOT make you a better photographer. Using a prime lens, however, like this very affordable option, will certainly improve your images.The cons are obvious: low build quality. This means that the lens is likely to last for only ten years or so, judging by the fact that other Canon primes (and all Canon lenses in general) are notoriously and incredibly reliable (the more expensive f/1.4 version of this lens a notable exception, but still very, very, very reliable).The sum of all my comments is but this: for the money, there is no finer nor more useful lens for your Canon EOS Camera.",What is the difference of iii to v?,['image quality from this'],[79],[1],[0.],[False]

So I was interested in testing out another company&#8217;s product with my iPad Mini.Getting the iPad Mini properly mounted was a bit of a chore, with it being a ruggedized case. I have used ruggedized cases, with keyboards, before with iPad and iPhone devices, soe I knew a few tricks to getting the case fitted around properly, although, getting the last bit of case properly fit into the home button section took a little work. The online video link included in the paperwork was a good resource for novices.I like that the keyboard charging is done through a standard style cable. In this case a micro USB connection. Good, because in case the included cable ever gets lost, those cables are easy to find. Charging the unit was very straight-forward, with the LED indicators. I followed the recommended initial charging time of 4 hours.Next was syncing the keyboard via Bluetooth. This was straight-forward process, especially if you have done this before with iOS devices. Instructions included in the paperwork were easy to follow. I was pleased with the responsiveness of the keyboard when typing. It felt natural, and the keyboard feels very durable, especially with it being a ruggedized case. There was also a clip on the front, to help keep the case closed, so it cannot accidentally open.When using the case, it is nice to be able to use the screen in either a portrait or landscape view. I do wish it was able to set into the case at a larger angle for viewing, while using it on a table. The Targus Versavu set at a nice angle for having on a table when typing. The arm that holds the iPad can be adjusted a bit for the viewing angle, but gravity with bring it down some over time. I like that if the keyboard is not needed, you can rotate and fold the screen against the keyboard, so that it can be held somewhat comfortably.The aspects of being a ruggedized case are well designed. the covers for the ports are fairly durable, and should last well over lots of use. Other ruggedized cases have had a cover over the camera, that you need to peel and move out of the way. This case leaves the camera exposed, and I really like that feature, because on some cases, that flap can pop back and disrupt the use of the camera. I like that in spots near the corners of my Targus Versavu that wore thru the felt material, this case does not have any materials I can observe will have the same issue.I think users that use their iPad mini a lot outdoors, would find this case quite useful in protecting their unit from dirt, water, and the elements. In general, anyone who finds themselves using their iPad outside, or transporting it in and out of vehicles would appreciate the durable design and function. Even if attached to a mount in a vehicle, like for law enforcement or delivery vehicles, it would work quite well.Product Rating on scale of 1 - 5: 5",Is this one an better choice to replace old machine?,[],[],[],[],[]

I honestly don't care whether it is high res or not but the old Nexus 7 had almost yellowish whites and uneven backlighting. This screen is 100% better.- another note about the screen. I was very worried that it wouldn't get dim enough for reading in the dark but it isn't any more troublesome than my old nexus 7 and it gets VERY bright for outside reading.- sound from the speakers seems better- I'm very happy to not have any of the main bugs (GPS and touch issues) that others are complaining about.Things that could be better:- the battery life while actually using the tablet isn't as good as the old Nexus 7. It isn't bad but I could use the battery up in a single day with a long web browsing session if I wanted to.- it is a little harder to hold - a combination of the back being less grippy and the side bezels (in portrait) being much smaller.- the screen can be overly sensitive at times. I don't think this is the same as the ghost touch bug because I've checked that the screen works properly with an app and I have no issues using swype.

The kind you don't have to argue about. It's there in quantity for any need you might have. That aside, I see this SRMT as 2 headphones in one (a bargain BTW) - the extra-bass model for gaming, TV action film, house and other bass-centric music, and the hi-fi model (using bass reduction) for symphonies, folk and acoustic, jazz, rock/pop/metal, and other such delicate genres. Unless otherwise noted, all comments below apply to the SRMT using bass reduction, since I listen to music only, and my tastes are mostly towards neutral reproduction.The SRMT sounds to me like a blend of two other headphones I have - the Marshall Monitor and the Beats Mixr. The SRMT's bass is extra strong like the Mixr, and when bass reduction is used, still has a stronger bass (including the deep bass) than most so-called high fidelity headphones. The rest of the range above the upper bass sounds more like the Marshall - darker than the Mixr, especially in the &#34;presence&#34; region or lower treble. Most other reviews I've read of the SRMT don't describe the sound very precisely, comparing to other known references like the Mixr, or even the old school headphones like the Sennheiser and Beyer models. I have a feeling that any critical reviews of the SRMT by the best-known establishment reviewers will find the combination of extra strong bass and some shyness in the lower treble - that will take points off of their ratings for this headphone.In my case, using bass reduction for critical listening at home, the balance is perfect, or as near perfect as anything else I have, and that's excellent. The sound overall has a darker tonality than the average headphone, including the Beats Mixr, and it's about the same as the Marshall Monitor. The reasons I believe the SRMT is a 2-headphones-in-1 bargain is because 1) The SRMT's sound using bass reduction is excellent, with no bothersome peaks or dips anywhere in the music frequency spectrum; 2) The sound played flat (no EQ) provides the extra bass that gets lost in many portable use situations - outdoors or on public transport for example; and 3) Where most &#34;bassy&#34; headphones don't have the extra strength in the deep bass that they have in the upper bass, and using bass reduction with those headphones results in a weak lower bass, the SRMT's lower bass remains solid with good impact. The only other headphones I recall having this good of a bass response are the v-moda M100 and the Beats Mixr.The overall sound of the SRMT is very smooth from top to bottom. Unlike some reviewers who go into minute detail about the many aspects of sound the customer is likely to experience with their new headphone, I stick to the things I can explain - the things that anyone can hear on their music player, computer, or portable headphone amp etc. Besides having a bass response that's solid and detailed (given the things I noted above), and a midrange that's just right (neither forward nor recessed), the SRMT's treble is also ideal - just strong enough with enough detail for reproducing the fine upper harmonic detail in voices and instruments, but not so strong as to make sibilants or other treble irritations from lower-quality music tracks bothersome. I rarely say anything about amps except that they improve the sense of space or &#34;air&#34;, but with the SRMT and my USB DAC/amps, the highs dried up more than when playing with the iPod alone, and I got better results with the FiiO E07k through the 'Aux' port.The SRMT's soundstage seems at least average, which is good for a closed-back headphone. Isolation also seems average for a closed headphone, and the leakage is low - low enough that playing the SRMT at a moderate volume level in a cubicle next to other cubicles in a quiet office should not be a problem. The music track examples listed below will tell my impressions of the SRMT's sound with that particular music. If you should happen to read other reviews on the SRMT that describe either the mids or treble as recessed, consider that those reviewers are playing the SRMT with the bass full up and that I'm using bass reduction. The reason I'm not reviewing the sound of the SRMT played flat (no EQ) is because many other reviewers have already done that, and I want to provide an alternative for customers who'd like to have a headphone like the SRMT, but wouldn't like extra-strong bass.The SRMT comes in several colors, and my video review shows the plain black version I purchased. The SRMT seems to be mostly plastic, including the headband I think, but the headbands are user-replaceable and are easily found at retail stores. I consider the build quality to be as good as the sound - excellent. The earcups are circumaural (around-ear), and they fit around my average or larger size ears with great comfort. There are 2 main classes of circumaural earcups in my experience - the large round cups like the Beyerdynamic DT770 and other Beyer series, or the Soundmagic HP100 and HP200, to name some examples. Then there are the smaller oval earcups/earpads like the Sennheiser Momentum, the Phiaton MS400, the v-moda M100, and the SRMT. The SRMT fits me better with greater comfort than any of these other small oval earcup/earpad designs.The headband clamp is fairly light for this type of headphone, and it's also very secure on the head, but the snug and secure fit may have a price - in very warm weather the earcups may feel overly warm. The 4-ft. straight cable is detachable and double-side entry, and the 2.5mm plug that goes into each earcup looks like a stereo plug, although the extra connector may have something to do with the start/stop and volume controls. The other end for the computer or music player is an Apple-style right-angle miniplug. The SRMT doesn't come with any sort of carry case, just a thin plastic-coated bag that won't protect the headphone from anything. If you need to take this headphone with you to various places and you don't want to wear it around your neck (that works very well BTW), I'd advise taking it apart - earcups and headband and cable - and packing them into whatever protective container you can find.In other reviews I've done I've included the following music examples with comments about how the headphones sound with each track. My suggestion is instead of reading each one as an absolute unto itself, you could compare my notes here to other reviews and see how the SRMT compares with each individual track. I copied these examples from my Beats Mixr review and then went through each one in a listening session, checking for any differences I heard from what I reported for the Mixr, and found only one or two minor differences - an excellent result. The SRMT is now one of my 4 favorite headphones, which includes the Beats Mixr, the Marshall Monitor, and the v-moda M100.Animotion - Obsession (1980's New Wave/Techno): The upper bass synth should have good detail and tone, and both male and female vocals should sound natural, without favoring either. The SRMT plays this perfectly.Ben Heit Quartet - Suite-Magnet and Iron (Jazz with a Bebop flavor): The piano that leads off should sound realistic, and the sax should sound soft. The SRMT plays this music extremely well.Cath Carroll - Moves Like You (1980's New Wave/Techno): This track's percussion and voice should be crisp and well-balanced, and there should be a good sense of space or soundstage around the voices and instruments. The SRMT reproduces the space and detail very well.Chromatics - I'm On Fire (Synth-Pop, female lead): Another track with plenty of space around the voice and instruments, making for a very pleasant stereo image. The voice sounds good and the tambourine in the background is clearly identifiable.Crystal Castles - Wrath of God (Electro-Pop): The moderate level of bass in this track should reproduce with good detail, and the ambient electronic effects should maintain their separation and never congeal into a glassy, hard, or &#34;ringy&#34; sound as some headphones might produce if they have uncorrected resonances. The SRMT does this one just right.DJ Shadow - Building Steam With a Grain of Salt (Electronic/DJ): This track opens with what sounds like very high and very low piano notes, and those high notes particularly might ring a few resonances in lesser headphones. The SRMT handles those notes well, and reproduces the ambient voices with good tone and balance.Franz Ferdinand - Ulysses (Pop-Rock): The moderate level of bass in this track should reproduce with good detail, and the percussion and voice should be crisp and well-balanced. The SRMT makes this sound like what I imagine the original producers heard when they mixed it.Halie Loren - Sway (Jazz vocal): Bass instrument(s) here may sound boomy with some headphones, but the SRMT handles this perfectly. The trumpet should sound natural but soft, and the voice should have the right presence without sounding recessed or too forward. The SRMT does a great job in both respects.Hans Zimmer - Dark Knight-Aggressive Expansion (Soundtrack): The percussion hits hard here, and the SRMT handles it well. The bass tones beginning around 0:45 into the track are the ultra-deep &#34;shuddery&#34; kind that require good deep bass response from a headphone, and the SRMT reproduces those deep notes even with bass reduction enabled as described above.Kaskade - 4am (Electro-House): The bass that kicks in around 1:01 into the track is subtle, but the SRMT gets it right. The percussion and female voice should balance well with neither overwriting the other, and the SRMT aces this.Katy B - Perfect Stranger (R&B-House-Garage;): The heavy bass that begins at 0:27 into this track is played very well by the SRMT. The voice is slightly forward, but it doesn't overpower the instruments or get lost in the mix. The SRMT balances the different elements in this music extremely well.Machine Gun Kelly - All We Have (Rap/Hip-Hop): The heavy bass beats that begin at 0:23 into the track should sound like drum impacts, although they're not sharp impacts. The male and female voices should have a good balance and not overpower the music or sound recessed. The SRMT plays this as good as can be expected given the limited quality of the recording.Massive Attack - Angel (Trip-Hop): This track begins with a steady low-frequency sound and some solid deep-bass impacts. The voices should blend well with the music and have just the right presence, although the recorded quality of the instruments isn't great. The SRMT plays this as good as can be expected given the limited quality of the recording.Morcheeba - Bullet Proof (Trip-Hop): Bright percussion and medium-strength bass impacts make up most of this, with some dance-club spoken intonations thrown in. The SRMT renders the percussion treble correctly (not too bright, not harsh), and the voices sound just right.Peter Tosh - Get Up Stand Up (Reggae): The bass here has a decent but moderate impact, and the lead and backup voices have good separation that's not too narrow or wide. The SRMT renders the bass with good detail and the voices sound very natural.Porcupine Tree - Trains (Pop-Rock): This track opens with some detailed string sounds and a forward-sounding male voice with a higher-than-average register. There are also some &#34;clip-clop&#34; effects starting at 3:19 that should sound like they were made with wooden blocks of some kind. The SRMT reproduces all of these sounds faithfully.Rachmaninoff - Prelude in C-Sharp Minor Op3 No2 (Classical, Piano): Grand piano played mechanically from an original recording by the master himself. The bass is light here, but the piano tone is good quality, and the SRMT plays these notes very well.Scarlatti-Kipnis - Sonata in E Major K381 (Classical, Harpsichord): The harpsichord here is fairly bright and highly detailed, and the SRMT renders the tones and transients superbly.Trombone Shorty - Backatown (Jazz-Funk): The deep bass impacts here are unusually strong, and work very well with the horns and other instruments. The SRMT delivers the impacts with proper weight, and makes the horns sound real.William Orbit - Optical Illusion (Billy Buttons Mix) (Electronic): This is about as close as I want to get to easy-listening music. The string(?) tones beginning at 0:18 are subtle, but clearly reproduced by the SRMT. The bass isn't very strong, but still adds a good underpinning to the music.

Having a prime lens (one that does not zoom in or out) forces you as the photographer to be the zoom and to move your body to the best possible position for the shot.  This makes you think so much more about your positioning during your shot and forces you to actually move around which is a huge positive.  Also, having a lens that has an aperture as wide open as 1.8 forces you to actually learn about aperture and when it is a good idea to shoot with it wide open at 1.8 and when it is a better idea to use a smaller aperture.  At first you'll be very tempted to shoot with it wide open, but I have found I more often shoot with this lens at 2.8 because the depth of field is more usable otherwise it's too easy to let's say have one eye in focus while the other eye is out of focus.Like many others I use this on a canon T3i with a 1.6 crop sensor which means this lens will actually be 80mm.  This makes it a very ideal lens for portrait photography but it can be a little tight for let's say street photography.  If the focal length is a little long I would suggest going with an 35mm prime instead.  This lens doesn't have as nice of a build quality as some of the more expensive canon lenses but the price is unbeatable and the image quality is unbelievable at this price point.  This is the lens that is on my camera 95% of the time and I recommend it to all of my photographer friends.

Before we got this lens, we usually carried three lens:Canon EF 17-40mm f/4L,Canon EF 50mm f/1.4and sometimesCanon EF 70-200mm f/2.8L IS II, and we paired them with our camera:Canon EOS 5D Mark II. So you can imagine how heavy is our backpack. We hope this lens can replace the other three lenses, such that it can cover landscape (24-35mm), portrait(50-85mm), and some wildlife at short distances (105mm). We understand that the quality may be sacrificed a little bit and may not be comparable to three other lens. We didn't expect that the difference is so big.We compared the image quality of this lens with the following lens. Notice that all images were shot at the same aperture/focal length. Also the scores below are relative/pair-wise.Candidate #1:Canon EF 17-40mm f/4L, Shoot at f/4 and 24mmBoth lens give similar result. However, I notice that 24-105 have some vignette issues (dark corner) at 24mm. Also, the image is not as sharp as 17-40.If the score of 17-40mm is 100, then this lens is 80.Candidate #2:Canon EF 50mm f/1.4, Shoot at f/4 and 50mmThe 50mm lens blows this lens away. The color of 24-105mm looks just weird at this focal length, and the image is not sharp (I want to say poor).If the score of 50mm is 100, then this lens is 50.Candidate #3:Canon EF 70-200mm f/2.8L IS II, Shoot at f/4 and 105mmWe did some portrait shots at 105mm. Surprisingly, the difference is reasonable and not too big. Similar to other tests, sharpness is an issue.If the score of 70-200mm is 100, then this lens is 70.ConclusionThis lens behaves okay in its shortest/longest focal length (i.e., 24mm and 105mm), and the image quality degrades at around 50mm. In fact, this is not the only lens having trouble with this problem. Other lens such asCanon EF 24-70mm f/4.0L ISalso performs poorly at 50mm. However, this was fixed in Canon EF 24-70mm f/2.8.Overall, the sharpness is a really big issue comparing to our collections. Although this lens offers a very attractive focal range, especially for hikers like us, we found that this lens is not a good fit for us because image quality matters than the weight of the lens.Suggestions:If you are using full-frame body, try to get aCanon EF 24-70mm f/2.8L II, Canon EF 24-70mm f/2.8L I, or Canon EF 24-70mm f/4.0L.If you are using crop-sensor body, don't waste your time with this lens. This lens is optimized for full-frame body. Try to get a higher-end EF-S lens such asCanon EF-S 17-55mm f/2.8 ISinstead.Update (5/2/2014)I ended up selling my copy and get a copy of 24-70mm. Now I couldn't be happier. Many people are undecided whether they should get a 24-105mm (around $700), or they should buy a 24-70mm a f/4($1500), or even f/2.8 ($2300). Let's take the f/4 one as example. It is similar to 24-105mm (same aperture, with IS) except that its focal length is shorter (70 vs 105), and it costs nearly twice more expensive ($1500 vs $700). It doesn't make sense for Canon to make a more expensive and less powerful product. The difference obviously is image quality. Remember one thing: You get what you paid for.Further reading:I highly recommend to compare the image quality using the tools developed by The-Digital-Picture.com. You can easily find the link by searching ""Canon Review"" on Google. Go to Tools --> Image Quality and try to play around with different lens, aperture and focal length. That will give you the best side-by-side comparison.",How did you like to zoom?,[],[],[],[],[]

I don't get out much, so my computer is convenient for everything else.I've had several Kindles and was happy with all of them, but I had recently played around with my brother's tablet. When my last Kindle died, I decided to replace it with the Kindle Fire. I chose the smaller one because I was concerned about my arthritic hands holding a larger device for long periods. The 7"" is just perfect for me. It's light enough that I can hold it to read, but the larger screen compared to the Kindle makes for easier reading. I love the color, something I never thought would make a difference to me.Oddly enough, high on my favorite list is the ability to review a book as soon as I reach the end. I have written reviews of every book I read on a readers social media site, but I have seldom put in the extra effort to come to Amazon to write a review. On the Kindle Fire, as soon as I come to the end of a book, a review page pops up so I can review it while it's fresh on my mind, and I'm reviewing everything I read.I didn't realize when I placed my order that I was ordering that the device had special offers. I've always thought I would not want to be subject to advertising when I was reading. However, I discovered that the special offers are discreet and no distraction at all. I've even found myself going to the special offers page a time or two to see what's on offer.The only negative is that the battery doesn't last very long. However, with the PowerFast charger, it doesn't take long to charge the battery.I think folks like me who have always used a dedicated ereader and never even used a touch screen will be pleasantly surprised with the Kindle Fire, and people who are used to smartphones and tablets will find everything they expect in a device.Update 11/8/13: I still think the Kindle Fire is a fantastic product, and I use it occasionally for games. However, I have gone back to my Kindle Keyboard for reading novels. The arthritis in my shoulders, elbows, and hands has  worsened since I've been using the Kindle Fire, and even using the device for a short while increases the pain significantly. I can tolerate it for short periods to play a few games. However, I simply can't hold the Kindle Fire long enough for reading.

Recently purchased an I Pad 2 and my son loaned me a pair of  unnamed earbuds. All  I can see is a S on the end of each bud. I was surprised  at how good they sound.My family owns an  iMac, Mac Pro Book, two iPhones and four IPods. Also own one hellava home  theater system. High end Harman Kardon AVR coupled to a Klipsch RF 7  horn loaded speaker system in a 7.1 configuration, Oppo Blu Ray hooked up to a top of the line 50 inch Panasonic Plasma. The Klipsch 12 inch sub literally shakes the pics on the wall. You can feel the bass in the pit of your belly.All that that being said is just to establish I know a little about music and the potential of how it can sound comng from quality equipment. My musical taste are wide, but at heart I am a  R & B purest loving great and funky bass lines. I just opened and hooked the Sennheiser CX  300 II buds up to my IPad II.First impression is they don't sound any better than the buds  my son loaned me. What is annoying so far is they are itching my inner ear canal.  The other buds don't do that.  I just switched them out to recheck again they definitely itch, not a good thing. I do detect an improvement in bass and the tremble is too shrill. I can see ear fatigue coming already. I understand music is recorded across a broad spectrum using various techniques. When you factor in the time span of my music collection, late 1960s until now, one can see it takes versatility to handleball of the content. I can attest that while the music is playing you cannot hear anything outside. My wife was watching a DVD and I could not hear a sound. In fact the bass sound waves fooled me because I could feel them in my belly, but I could not hear anything.I am well aware of burn in as my Klipsch speaker system required it and indeed over time they sounded better. I hope this is the same with these buds. I am not saying they are bad buds at all. I am saying the verdict is still out. At the price point $24, Idon' t see a mistake.

Listening to Michael McDonald's, I Second That Emotion is a treat. The bass is deep and clean, the midrange is good also.

She has been so thrilled. This is a great tablet for her. I really struggled with which tablet to get for her. Yes she is 8 and its an extream gift, but we knew she would use it and take care of it. The tablet is made really well with a great feel to it. If it wasnt for an 8 year old i would not have bought a case for it, it just has that good of a feel to it.  I chose this tablet because it was for a child and i know there is only so much she would need it for. Mostly entertainment. Yes it is, in a sence, a way for amazon to get you to buy from them all kinds of media, but im happy with that. I love amazon. Everybody in the family knew she was receiving this for christmas so it made it easy for them to buy a gift card to excatly the place she would want one to. On a parent note...i chose this tablet for 2 deciding factors. One: its user friendly. I didnt have to spend an hour trying to figure out how to operate it. It came registered to my amazon account, and when i wanted to put my daughters name on the kindle instead of the name it came registered to ( mine) it was a snap. And those types of things usually take me forever to figure out. Everything on this device is very simple to use. I was worried how to swap things in and out of the cloud before i received it, but that also is so easy. You dont even have to think about it. Its plainly there and explains itself. So for anybody that wants a tablet but struggles with electronics and how to make them work right, this is for you. I wish all devices were this easy. The second deciding factor for me was the parental controls. And im not even using the free time feature. That adds even greater saftey and control even over how long your kids are allowed on it. But just from the standard functions i was able to set a passcode for turning wifi on, im able to block anything i want without locking everything as a whole. I can block just movies, or just the web, so thats why i went with the kindle,its the tablet she asked for, but it was a great choice. The ease of use and the great parental controls the other tablets didnt offer. The picture qualty is amazing, as well as the sound. They are not lying when they say these features are great. So this is just my 2 cents on my thoughts on this device for our 8 year old.  My daughter has also done more reading on this tablet in a week then she ever has, so its been very good for her on that end as well.",How is ease way?,[],[],[],[],[]

I know I will not be in a position to take full advantage of this router's features for a while because most of my devices lack 5GHz capability but in spite of that there is  no doubt it will help overall network performance. While it appears to be positioned at the modest end of the manufacturer's dual band router product line, there is nothing modest about its' usefulness.Using the resource mini-cd for the setup assistant application, basic installation was completed in less than ten minutes, not factoring in the number of individual devices I needed to reconfigure to identify the new SSID(s) and password(s).  In order to create guest networking, a firmware update from the TP-LINK's website has to be installed. It should be noted the downloaded files must be extracted using WinZip or WinRAR, which might encumber some casual users. If the intention is to continue to use the Assistant app, there also appears to be another firmware update required to coincide with the other the other firmware modifications, as I discovered when I lost connectivity and couldn't restore it via the CD copy.  I didn't download it as I have enough familiarity with router configuration that I had already decided to log onto the administrative page and make manual changes before I realized there was a fix available.With theoretical transfer rates up to 300Mbps over both the 2.4GHZ and 5GHZ bands which results in the published combined rate of 600Mbps,  the router has already proven to be a nice step forward for my home/ home office network even though most of my activity will remain on the lower bandwidth at `g' standard. With two detachable external antennas, I would rate overall signal strength as good but not outstanding over 2.4GHZ. On the alternate band, degradation to some problematic areas in my house was evident (and expected) yet tolerable without with use of a range extender or access point.On a laptop where I swapped the existing adapter for a dual band `n' standard adapter I experienced an immediate consistent increase from the customary 36 to 46Mbps I was used to to 84Mbps via 5GHZ. That will be beneficial for streaming music and video files and networked backups to and from my media server and NAS. I'm sure most users will also be aware the 5GHZ band will only be visible on devices with dual band adapter capability and network names have to be segregated. As expected, WAN transferal over either band was not improved significantly as ISP limitations come into play there although there did appear to be a slight improvement as interference from other networks in my area is minimal on the 5GHz band.Naturally, some of us want caviar at catfish prices so it would have been great if the router had gigabit ethernet ports but it does have a USB port for networking printers and storage devices , freeing up another ethernet port for another device. It also has a power switch, a convenience absent on many devices in this price range, and  wireless on/off switch which is convenient for disabling broadcasts when one is away but needs to leave the network running for some processes like scheduled backups to a networked storage device.One interesting thing was I swapped out my normal adapters for the TP-LINK WDN 3200 thinking paired products from the same manufacturer might marginally improve performance but it turned out the opposite was true. On a laptop and older desktop PC, signal strength was actually lessened by 20% I tend to believe that may be attributable to the adapters lack of external antenna. I did not try the USB type adapter with an external cord which could have impacted results by facilitating different angles.",How is design?,[],[],[],[],[]

It was everything I wanted and needed. Anyways, I had watched the keynote in September 2012, thinking ""No matter what, I'm keeping my old iPod touch"". By the end of the presentation, I was drooling over the new one. So, I sold my 4th gen. and bought this one in December 2012. Best choice ever.Upgrades over Fourth Generation:Build: It is so sleek compared to the 4th gen. I love the feel, and the ""squarer"" sides make it easier to hold and press the volume and power buttons. It is slightly harder to rest in my hand (my pinky acts as the support), but I attribute that to not having a case. It will wobble the tiniest bit, but having the loop button pushed out when flat helps to stabilize it. Also, the loop strap gives me more control when using one hand (and that is still easy, if not better with my longer fingers).-----------------------------------Screen: The screen size on the 5th gen. is a huge difference from previous generations. A family member still has the 4th, and it amazes me how stocky it looks now. The new length is great, as I do not have to scroll as often, and I can see more of the screen when I am using both hands (and I have small hands). It is definitely more responsive, and no glitches like a previous reviewer stated. The home button is more responsive as well, so I have to learn not to press it so much. The colors are more true to life now, and the screen is not blue or yellow tinted, just normal. The black bars for non-iPod touch 5 (worded as iPhone 5 in the App Store) optimized apps remind me just how small the previous screen was. Most well-known apps are optimized.-----------------------------------Sound: The speaker is slightly louder than the 4th gen. I can officially retire my cereal bowls. However, I have found that having the speaker on the right is a bit of a disadvantage, because I tend to cover it in landscape (right-handed). No biggie. The new EarPods are amazing. They fit much better in my ears, so I can sleep without taking them out. The bass is greatly improved. I never knewRock With You (Single Version)had background bass!-----------------------------------Durability: The anodized aluminum is sturdier than the previous metal back of the 4th gen. The top corner of my iPod just ""slapped"" the side of a tile counter today, and I was very pleased to not find one nick, scratch, or dent. I have yet to see any scratches (I have the White/Silver), and the back is finger-print resistant for the most part. I managed to get some sticky candy cane residue on the screen and sides last week, but I was able to wipe it off with a cloth. Oh, and the loop is sturdy. I have not yet bought a case because of this, as it is super easy to slip on, and it actually helps me steady the iPod in my hand. I'll probably buy some more loops instead of a case. I hated ruining my 4th gen.'s look with a case, even if it was clear. The iPod can hang by the loop and not fall off, which is good in case I lose my grip. The loop is hard to pull off without loosening it (unlike a Wii Remote strap), and has soft fabric where it meets your arm, so I can tighten it without a loss of circulation.-----------------------------------Speed: So, I had to do a few speed tests with a spare 4th generation. The 5th gen. boots in about ten seconds from reset, the 4th gen. takes 20-30 seconds. I opened the App Store in 6 seconds on the 5th gen., while the 4th gen. took 9 seconds. The Camera app launched in 2 and 3 seconds, so hardly any difference there. Overall, the 5th gen. decreases wait time. I don't find myself tapping my fingers like I'm using a Windows PC. It's a click, then a 5 second wait for games, and a 1 second wait for other apps. Safari is also faster, and connects quickly. I find myself with hardly any startup time, which my 4th gen. could take 5-10 seconds. By the way, my iPod touch has YET to crash at all, not even on Safari (which was a leading crasher on my 4th gen.). Graphic-intensive games no longer freeze, and my iPod only warms slightly (the 4th gen. felt like fire).-----------------------------------Camera: This will be short. It's better, period. You get LED flash (Which is an outstanding flashlight with iHandy's app), HDR for enhancement, and less noise. The 4th gen. catches NOTHING at night, while I was able to take a VERY CLEAR semi-family photo with flash in a pitch black room. The video is smoother, and clearer, and the LED flashlight can be used in conjunction with the video camera. Great for nighttime missions.-----------------------------------Battery life: Please do not pay attention to the lemon reviews. I have great battery life. With no WiFi, I was able to get a whopping ten hours of video, photos, games, and etc. Now, my 4th gen. would have died three times over. The calibration of the battery stays accurate. My 4th gen. showed 40-50% after thirty minutes of gaming. The 5th gen. still showed 65-75%. Awesome in my book, as I like to game without being plugged up. These numbers are with Wifi connected. On weekdays, I get a full day (9 a.m.-10 p.m. | Safari, Stock apps, Plaintext) without needing to charge. Weekends are about five hours (Gaming, communication, videos).-----------------------------------Siri and Dictation: Once she learns your voice, Siri can take you far. She didn't really have problems with my accent (I have a moderate Southern accent, and people said Siri couldn't understand them), so the user feedback must be working. She did have problems with drop (thinking it was job), and check (thinking it was Chad), but those are probably the fault of my own tongue. Dictation actually seems to work better than Siri, and it is better than writing long texts (I'm very thorough). I also enjoy the decrease of ""manual labor"". Reminders, FaceTime calls, Messages, Searches, even opening apps are handled through Siri. I never thought the days of a handheld robot would come. ;)-----------------------------------Overall: This was a must-do upgrade for me. I was cross that my 4th gen. was already a year old, and after seeing iOS 6 on it, I knew it would have a slim chance of making it to iOS 7. So, I decided to get onto the 5th's cycle. That was the best choice for me. I was very glad to see so many improvements, and each one is worth it. If you have a lemon, please return and exchange it. Don't give up on this great device.=========================================================================================================Six Month Update (June 24th, 2013):-----------------------------------Speed: My fifth generation is still running as fast as ever, and does not show any signs of slowing down. There is hardly any boot time for apps, and even graphic-heavy apps play smoothly.Screen: The four-inch screen is just so much better for my fingers. I never accidentally press the top of the iPod when I wanted to touch the back button on apps. The screen is nice and bright, and I love the true-to-life colors. I only use a dry fabric (microfiber cloth, shirt, pillow, recliner arm) to wipe the screen. Never use water, or you'll rub off the oleophobic coating and the oils from your skin, which makes the screen easier to swipe and scroll. Also, the screen is very durable, so I can use my nails (they are very firm) to scrap off sticky whatnot, and not worry about leaving a scratch.Siri: After a few months hiatus, I decided to use Siri again. After taking off some contacts' information, I feel safe enough to use the service, and it works splendidly. I'm glad that I don't need to give her my info just to use it, as that's not my preference. I use her to text others when I'm busy and don't want to stop. Timers and reminders are good to use with her, because I have a million of them. Those are such a *pain* to make. . .Sturdiness: Keeping with the s-themed update, I have to talk about this iPod's sturdiness. Just good craftsmanship on Apple's part, seriously. In six months, I only have a side dent and a nick. The back is still nice and smooth, and I would rest it on any surface without a second thought. The loop is history (RIP), and this device is slippery without it. I bought a Belkin case a few months ago, and there has been no more damage to my device, so I'm happy all around.",How is the device?,['iOS'],[251],[1],[0.],[False]

However InDesign does not seem to suffer. Apple Safari does not work if you want use the scroll wheel but it's still mostly functional. General use is very unpredictable, you will need to adjust to the mouse rather than making adjustments to suit your needs.A few positive remarks: The build quality is top notch and the mouse is more comfortable than anything else I've used for important tasks. A very nice feature is it uses a AA battery so you can toss a freshly recharged battery while you recharge the one that you used up. I typically get about 4 weeks per charge working 7 days a week.Save your money and wait for an update in a few years.

If possible, only use a Broadcom or other chip which allows for better options in horrible firmware.Original:I'll start by giving my credentials, and after that you can take it as you wish.  I'm Cisco certified and work on networks for a living.  I've owned dozens of routers in the past, and I'm a major fan of Cisco, as I was Linksys.Here's the problem:  Cisco/Linksys created this new line of routers with a chipset that was meant for blocking techies from modifying the firmware/software on it.  As simple as it may seem, the hardware/chips are flawed, and have major issues.With that said, here's what's happened so far:1. In 2 different locations of residence, I've experienced the same issues.2. I've worked with Linksys/Cisco to try to resolve the issue, and I'm on my second one with the issue starting to occur again.3. I've changed channels, equipment and so forth, but Wireless on this device is very, very bad.What are the issues?1. Poor reception on some units.2. Constant disconnecting on most Laptops.3. Major issues when using an Xbox.  If you have an xbox, avoid this router like the plague.  Even when port forwarding and MTU is configured, you will kill connections to ALL other devices on the network.4. ""Auto"" channel is absolutely useless.5. No external antennas.6. Overheats like it's its job, even when in the open.7. Too much ""over simplifying"" for end-users has turned it into a piece of garbage.  Being easy is one thing, but adding a massive amount of trash to an install to make it better, ends up creating more problems in the end.8. No options for Tomato or DD-WRT, as it's locked down.9. Service stinks.  You'll be hours trying to get an RMA if that's even your problem; mine ended up just being that the hardware is horrible.In summary, don't buy this thing.  I had a netgear dual band router that was 10 times the reliability that this is, and it's hard for me to say that, considering I literally work on Cisco equipment all day.  I only switched because lightning burnt up my Netgear and this one was cheaper.  Never again will I make the same mistake.  I promise you, you'll eventually be disappointed in this.",What is design?,[],[],[],[],[]
electronics,clear,low,heavy,bass,1fd11448a683d53045a3e6a22de7b35e,1,0.5,False,8ea8e1a7c31b62a9fc5c838db5f21afc,326a430b1ca2d81d1feddee24ca90289,B0038W0K2K,"I have two points to make for the sake of full disclosure before actually writing a review of these headphones. First off, I received a free pair of the M6P headphones in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. I will do my best to deliver on my end of the bargain, with a review written for those wondering if they should spend their hard-earned money on the M6P. Secondly, I have never been an in-ear headphone person. I've used plenty of in-ear headphones in my day, but I have always preferred over-ear headsets as I find them to be, nine out of ten times, much more comfortable and high quality in their sound. That been said, I have been massively impressed by these headphones so far. Let's get to it then, shall we?As with any headphones, primary concern for me is sound. How does the M6P fare in that regard? Surprisingly well. I have never owned a pair of in-ear headphones that has had such a good sound range as these do. Usually, this sort of headset is severely lacking in bass and lower-mid tones, but the M6P has a genuinely fantastic range. Of course, the bass isn't quite what you'd get with over-ear phones, but honestly, it sounds pretty great. A little adjustment to equalization settings is all it takes for it to sound the way I like. Highs, mids, and lows are all  distinct and clear, with no one aspect overpowering the others. I've really enjoyed my time with the M6P so far. They also look pretty cool. I got the ""clear"" option, and it's got a nice clean science fiction look to it. I like it.The M6P has several features that are worth noting as well. The last three or so inches of cords that go into the headphones themselves are made of a much stiffer material than the rest of the cord is. This ""memory wire"" is there is so you can mold them around your ear, making these headphones perfect to use while exercising or working. I have a physical job that allows me to listen to music while working, and these headphones have been incredibly nice for that. They rarely jostle or fall out. If you're looking for a good set of headphones for use while working out, these are ones I'd give serious consideration. The M6P also has an inline universal control that has a surprisingly large variety of uses for only having a single button, a volume slider, and a built-in microphone. The volume slider is incredibly nice as you don't have to fight to get your iPod/Mp3 player out of your pocket to adjust the volume. Same goes for the single button, which can be use for playing/pausing music and even skipping or restarting tracks depending on how you press it. The mic works pretty well for phone calls too. Overall, the inline universal control is a pretty convenient feature I rather appreciated. It's a pretty high-end feature that I've never had on any in-ear headphones before.The M6P comes in an attractive little box with plenty of accessories in addition to the headphones themselves. There's a really small zip-up case that carries other things in addition to the headphones. There's a really nice folded up users manual that is very helpful in getting acquainted with the product and its various features. There's also a small zip-lock baggy with several different types of rubbery ear tips you can switch out if the default ear-tips don't suit your fancy. I really appreciated the extra ear-tips, as each of the six pairs pretty much guarantees that, no matter what your ears are shaped like, you will be able to enjoy these headphones comfortably. That's great. There's also a little clip that can be used to attach the phones into your shirt or whatever, which is a nice feature that helps keep the pressure off your ears if the cord gets tugged a bit. Overall, a nice package.Truly, these are great headphones, but they're not without some quirks to consider. The memory wire, as great as it is for keeping the phones in your ears, makes it so the headphones take longer to put in than others would be. Once you put the earbuds in your ears, you'll want to make sure you won't need to take them out for a little while. I also found the memory wire a pain to struggle with right out of the box until they had broken in. The memory wire on the right-earbud on mine were particularly stubborn for a little while. Once broken in, however, the memory wire is very easy to make conform to your ears and wroks great. Finally, and this is admittedly a nitpicky gripe, I don't care for the plug-in jack myself. It is angled at 90', with an L-shape. I prefer straight plug-ins for headphones, but that's just my preference, and doesn't really take the quality of the phones down at all. None of these are issues that would keep me away from the M6P, mind you, but they are quirks to keep in mind.All things considered, these are fantastic headphones. I've been supremely surprised by their high quality in comparison to all the other in-ear headphones I've owned. I have friends with high-end in-ear headsets that were twice the price (or higher) as these, but in my opinion, the M6P is much higher quality in terms of sound and has a much more robust feature set. These are a pretty awesome deal at $40! It appears you can get them for even cheaper than that on Amazon too, which astounds me. I'd definitely give these a hearty recommendation at this price. They're a great set of headphones. I hope you found this review helpful. Thanks for reading. Toodles.",How is the bass?,[],[],[],[],[]

I've been using the VX Revolution for a few years now.  And I need two thumb buttons.  I can't live without my shortcuts.I've been using the VX Revolution for a few years.  Even though advertised as a 'laptop mouse', I found it fit my hand better than the desktop version.  But they never lasted - the left click would last a year or two, and I'd have to replace the mouse.  This time the VX Revolution was discounted so I had to search for a replacement.  The M705 turnout to be like the VX Revolution refreshed....I've been using the M705 for about two months now and I'm a happy camper.  The mouse has a great shape and fits in my right hand very well .  top buttons are comfortable and snappy.  And the thumb buttons are in a great location - not in my way so I keep clicking them, but no so far away I have to stretch the thumb.  The left and right surfaces have a gripping surface, but your fingers won't stick to them.The M705 has two more features I've gotten used two.  There's a third 'hidden' thumb button.  When you press the thumb down it can trigger another function (I have it set to Expos&eacute;).  The scroll wheel also has a handy button next to it.  Usual wheel response is your standard 'notched' feeling (click-click-click as you scroll).  There's a small button out-of-the-way behind the scroll wheel that will switch between 'click' mode and smooth mode.  In smooth mode the wheel will spin freely.  And it's very free - it'll spin for a good 15-20 seconds on the new mouse.  if I have a huge browser window to scroll through, smooth-mode is great!  I don't know how I would live without it.The mouse comes with the 'standard' Logitec control center software, which is working just fine on MacOS 10.6.  Actually, I didn't have to install any software - I had it installed for the VX Revolution - so the Control Center automatically recognized the new mouse with no problems.Not many downsides.  This mouse takes two AA batteries rather than just one - not sure why that is.  There is an on/off switch on the bottom if you want to save batter life.  And, like every mouse I've ever owned, the feet pick up a lot of dust and such from the desk.  No worse than any other mouse.  I'll have to wait a year or two to see if this lasts longer than the VX mouse.  And, of course, never happy paying $50 for a mouse..So happy camper here.  Very very happy with the M705, and would highly recommend it.",How is the shape?,[],[],[],[],[]

The 3-star rating at this point now is ONLY because they are comfortable, lightweight and have great sound quality--when it works.  I own so many pairs of these JBuds as to be ridiculous.  I owned several J2 and every color of the J3 just in the past year.  The last J3 I bought in August I kept as backup in case of failure (I use them for medical transcription, sitting at my desk hardly moving for 10-12 hours daily).  I had a failure of the silver earlier this month only a few months into use; the wires seem to come loose somewhere causing loss of sound in one side. Not even 2 hours of use after opening the brand new black set, they failed. Just like all the others but the lasting time for these silver and black ones has been insanely short, and I'm extremely careful with them. I went back to J2, thinking perhaps there to be a design flaw in the J3.  Nope.  Only 4 hours into use on the first day and one side has already failed.  I'm sick of this.  I've gone through probably a dozen pair of various JLab earbuds now, most within the last year, and the timetable for failure has increased exponentially just in the past few months.  I have given this product more than its fair share of chances.No more JLab products for me. I'm just done.  They used to be amazing and long lasting.

In order to use with Windows, you do in fact have to download the HFS+ driver from the Seagate website and reformat the drive (at least, this drive wasn't recognized by my PC running Windows 7). Of course if you are a Windows-only user, you probably would not even consider this product because of the name ""Backup Plus for Mac"". (You'd probably get the sister productSeagate Backup Plus 3 TB USB 3.0 Desktop External Hard Drive (STCA3000101), which also costs less.) Also, I'm not sure if this Backup Plus for Mac can go back to Mac once it is reformatted for Windows. I got it for my Mac and was afraid to try it.For this Seagate drive, which is an upgrade from theSeagate FreeAgent GoFlex Desk 3 TB USB 3.0 External Hard Drive STAC3000102, it has a much slicker look and a unique adapter compatible with USB, Firewire and Thuderbolt.

If you frequently upload media from different devices such as a smart phone, tablet, digital camera, and desktop computer to Facebook, Flickr, or wherever, and want them backed up, this software really makes your job easier. What is more, it organizes photos by creating folders of each photo album, timeline, cover and profile.On my Mac, I have three other external drives attached in addition to this one, so I decided to do a quick benchmark test. I timed the speed to copy 2.6GB photos from my Mac to each drive. I used the same USB cable and the same USB port for all four tests.

Ultrasonic motor and metal mount give the lens a very proffessional feel.  Granted, you can tell the difference between this lens and the much more expensive L version, but as far as picture quality goes, the difference is not so obvious.Bokeh you obtain with such a wide aperature is terrific for portraits, at aperatures from 1.4-2.0 there is some softness to the lens which gives portraits a bit of a ""dreamy"" look.  This is desired from many, but I don't particularly care for it.  Nevertheless, shots become extremely sharp after 2.0 and continue to improve to f 8.0.As far as whether you should purchase this particular lens or the less expensive 1.8 model, it really comes down to personal preference.  Budget is an important issue as you can get one for less than $90 and the other for around 330. The less expensive one has a plastic mount, which wont last as long, and it just feels less solid.  It also has a comparitavely loud and slower autofocus motor than the 1.4, and the focus ring is nearly non-existant.It took me a while to choose between the two, mainly because of the cost,  but finally decided on this one, I have not been dissapointed.",How is the difference?,['the difference is not so obvious'],[379],[2],[0.5],[False]

Some folks have been confused just putting their Nexus 7 into this case (even breaking things!)So let's clarify that:The Front CoverThe outside of the front cover has the Nexus logo. The inside of the front cover has a strap 1 inch wide for your hand, two deep grooves, and a thin elastic black strap.The Back CoverThe outside of the back cover has a shallow fold-line. While the back cover is delivered flat, it is designed to be folded, well,  at the fold-line! (Don't bend the front cover!) But do go ahead and fold the Back Cover back at the fold-line. This fold turns the back cover into a support when you use the Nexus 7 in this case in the horizontal Landscape orientation.The inside of the back cover has six padded fingers. Two of those fingers are off by themselves. The other Four are clustered together. You (a) slightly fold the back cover, (b) then slide your Nexus 7 into those four fingers - exactly like sliding a drawer back into furniture. When all the way into the four fingers and stopped at two corners, (c) you flatten the back cover and (d) move last two corner fingers gently (one by one) over the corners of the tablet. You're done!For helpful video reviews search U-Tube. (That may require Flash which the Nexus 7 does not come with, but you can try the Firefox browser which does support Flash on your Nx7.)You can close the case and the magnet in the front cover will put your tablet to sleep. Open the case, the tablet wakes up. With the front cover swung all the way back around to lie against the back, you can put your left hand into the strap for a more secure grip on the tablet in its case. Video reviews show how the thin elastic black band can be routed to hold things snug and leave the screen clear.With the case open, if you just un-clip only those last two fingers you finished up with, by folding the back cover again you can swing the bottom long side of the tablet into one of the deep grooves inside the front cover. The case will then hold your Nexus 7 very nicely in Landscape orientation.Now - Why The MoKo Slim-Fit Is A Most Excellent Case For The Nexus 7This case protects the critical corners when (not if) the tablet is dropped)A surprising number of cases do not. Landing on a side can distribute the shock, but landing on a corner can concentrate them into a disaster for the tablet, and ruin your whole day.This case reasonably protects the sides as well and top when the case is open.When the case is closed, your tablet is really quite secure.The price is modest - this case costs as little as 7.6% the price of your tablet!(I chose the genuine leather version so that comes to a 12% insurance premium, but I love leather.)The workmanship - at these prices - is very good.Given the pain and anguish I'd feel if I accidentally smashed my tablet, I will happily order another identical MoKo Slim-Fit case whenever this one shows significant wear -- just renewing my tablet's insurance.I've had this case for over a month, used it all day, every day, and it is still as good as new.My only quibble is I wish these same good people made a similar case for my new Nexus 4 smart-phone...  and maybe one for people so you could protect them, enjoy them in portrait or landscape mode, but that's just being whimsical.",How is the leather?,['Fit Genuine LeatherA Most Excellent' 'Slim'],[14  9],[1 1],[0.6 0.6],[ True  True]

At f/1.8, it's close to impossible not to get a great photo. I mean, really, you can take a photo of anything, anywhere, and make it look great. It's bright, the colors are perfect, f/1.8 is really fun, it's sharp and high contrast, and the bokeh is amazing (not all that smooth, but still really nice).The build is terrible, though. It's light, which is nice, but, honestly, this thing feels like a Tupperware container. The focus ring, especially, because it shakes around, it's tiny, and it just feels like dry plastic against dry plastic. Autofocus isn't any better. It's loud and obnoxious. It's pretty fast and accurate, but it's not pleasant, being jerky and stiff. After using it for a while, I stop noticing it, but when you're thinking about it, it's terrible.There are definitely better 50mm's that you could buy, but I couldn't believe the photo quality that I got for $100. Overall, I'm happy with my decision. Despite having a terrible build, it's my most used lens. Actually, come to think of it, because I use it so much, I probably should have bought the f/1.4. Hm.

I created the account and was presented with a new way to manage my router.  The new way has a new (and improved) management screen that makes it easy to manage, it takes some time to get used to, but it is very user friendly (I am used to the more technical way, so I have to look closer through the options to find most stuff).  The system is nice since you can access it from different computers without using your home network.  You can now use neat apps to limit the network (like content and media and protect your network), most apps are advertised and some are available for Android, but most say coming soon for iPhone.  Some look promising and the new system is neat.  I look forward to the improved version for iPhone (over Cisco Connect Home). -- One thing to point out, the Cisco Cloud will log you out if you do not stay active (kind of bad for your own router...), but the device list customization is nice and you can add custom names and images for each item (to easily recognize suspicious devices.The iPhone app is also available in the Apple App Store and is a small install.  Once I logged in (with the account I created when I launched the router page), from the app you can see the status of your network (is it connected to internet, who [what devices] are connected), you can also edit most parts of the router settings (not the more advanced stuff, like the QoS, Gaming, and Internet settings), but you can edit passwords, wireless names and passwords, and guest access.  Pretty neat, and it will be fun to see what other apps become available that make this even better.I also wanted to add that when I tried to add my USB Storage device, I ran into trouble.  I had the drive formatted in exFAT (I did not want the 4GB file size limitation of FAT 32 nor a specific to Windows or Mac (since I use both)).  I plugged in the drive and the Cloud Connect did not recognize it.  I contacted support and they informed me that the router only supports: FAT32, NTFS and HFS+ formats.  So, I wanted to let you all know, just in case you try to use it with a LINUX formatted or exFAT formatted drive.  I am going to format it into NTFS and use the network only to connect to it from my Mac.  Once it was formatted for NTFS, the Cisco Connect Cloud recognized it instantly.  The settings were easy to understand and there were easy options to setup FTP settings for accessing files over the internet (I did not want this, since I just wanted to share the drive on the local network).  When I opened Finder on my Mac I could get to my drive over the router name in Shared section.  The USB storage section also included addresses to access your storage drive.I was excited to see this router after seeing the online push and emails that Cisco has sent out advertising there new Router with Apps.  I was curious on what they would utilize with the Apps.  Since my E4200v2 and E2000 both support the Cisco Connect Express app from my iPhone.  Apparently the big app, that is what all the buzz is about is the Cisco Connect Cloud.  I looked around for it, and it is not advertised on the box or on many sites, so I finally found it on the Cisco website, but it apparently will not be available until the Summer (I always believe that stuff should not be released until all the features are available, with apps and cloud based services this type of delay has become quite prominent). So I cannot use the main new feature until later...  Cisco says once it is available the Cisco Connect app/software will alert me.  As soon as it is available I will definitely try it out, but I have a fear with that high amount of Upstream traffic will slow my network down (I have AT&T; DSL), so I am curious about it, and will update my review when it is available.Now for the router itself:Like I said, I am updating from a Linksys E4200v2 to the Linksys EA4500.  So far there is no difference.  They have the exact specs (from what I see), just the new one has app enabled (for an app that is not out yet...)So Since they are near identical routers, installation was similar.  I never like using the install CDs, since I do not want there software on my computers.  So I plugged into the router using a network cable, and went to the router's home page (192.168.1.1).  The default setting is username: admin, password: admin.  I then from the main page set up my DSL connection, so since I have AT&T; DSL, I selected PPPoE, then inserted my att email and then my password (provided by your DSL provider), it is a different approach for Cable Internet (MAC Cloning is the easiest), although if you are not sure how to do this you might want to go with the software, I am familiar with setting up networks, so it is easier to do it manually.  Set your routers IP here, and the range of addresses for leasing (you can just use the default, unless you need more than 50 devices, then change it accordingly).I then went to the Wireless tab and set up Manual WiFi settings, I like broadcasting on the 2.4 and 5GHz so I can manually connect my 5GHz devices to this network and my 2.4GHz to there network (although 2.4GHz devices cannot see the 5GHz broadcast).  I gave each network a recognizable name for my network, and then used WPA-2 Personal for encryption, make sure to use at least two combinations (numbers + letters or + symbols), it makes brute force attacks nearly impossible due to time required (I use letters + numbers + symbols).\I then set up the Guest Access (which can be done from the web interface, this was not possible on the E2000s), I gave it a name and a password and limited it to 5 guests.  Guest access creates a network separate from your main network, different IP address group for the two (for example my home is 192.168.1.XXX, and my guest is 192.168.3.XXX), this way guest cannot see my machines on my main network.  A neat feature when relatives come over.I then went over to Quality of Service and set my Media Center, Roku 2, and Skype Applications as High Priority to ensure that they work properly even if I have a lot of activity on other devices.I also went into the DHCP Reservation (Home page toward bottom), and gave my Printer a Static IP address.  To do this go to DHCP and then if you see your printer in the list check the box next to it and hit Add, then give it a name and Static address.  You then need to tell the printer to use that Static IP (this ensures proper behavior).  If you do not see your item yet in the Client list, you can get your MAC address from the device (make sure to get Wireless if you plan to connect wirelessly or Wired if you plan to connect over Wire (they are different MAC addresses, even in the same machine! [Separate network devices]).  Then in the DHCP Client type in a name, your preferred IP address and then the MAC address.  I do this for printers to ensure that computers that connect to it using its IP address stay connected even if the network reboots and issues out new IP addresses (it takes a little extra time, but is worth it to ensure devices like Printers stay active on the network).This device can have USB HDD and USB Printer plugged in to serve as a file or print server.  This is great for people who have older USB printers and want to share it across the network without keeping a PC running all the time just to host it.  The file sharing is also nice for large USB HDD that you want access to over the network.In the end this is a great router, has some great features and is easy to install and monitor (whether you use the Cisco Connect or the Web Interface), I look forward to playing with the Cisco Connect Cloud (and wish that when devices come out that their new features were available at release), but in the end if you need a router able to handle larger networks, and high entense applications (I canceled Satellite for Internet Streaming and Off Air broadcasting (HD HomeRun to Media Center Computer with Hulu Desktop) and Roku 2, and canceled home phone for a Skype subscription.  Therefore, I need a router that can handle this type of network activity, and these routers (EA4500, E4200v2) have worked perfectly and never have any problem keeping my network live!  Highly recommend!!!",Was it issue ?,[],[],[],[],[]

We also wanted to save some money by discontinuing our Dish Network service. At first, I was thinking about purchasing an external HDTV antennae but was daunted by the installation. I then decided to look at indoor antennas and came across the Mohu Leaf. I was intrigued that it got excellent reviews. I wasn't very hopeful because of our location. I live in Apex, NC and our subdivision is surrounded by a lot of trees and we get poor AT&T; cellphone service. But I was encouraged that Mohu has a great return policy. I figured that if it didn't work, I will just return it.I plugged it into my HDTV and had the television do a channel search. The first time I did this, I did not get a lot of channels but after moving it a couple of times (and having my TV do another channel search after each move), I was able to get 19 channels! Among a few minor channels, I got the major networks including PBS, CBS, ABC, Fox, NBC, and The CW. And guess what, at normal viewing distances, the picture quality is comparable to Dish!I'm even contemplating of buying a DVR. There are a few devices that don't even require a monthly subscription. But I'm still thinking about this. It's very tempting to be able to record all the network shows like Fringe, Desperate Housewives, or Dancing with the Stars.

Without writing a novel, here are the high/low points of this unit. In addition to this unit, I also purchased a couple of aftermarket batteries (and after market A/C adapters for about $5.00 each) for about $5.00 each and the batteries work fine. With the battery (original and aftermarket) I was able to get over 300 shots (50% flash) with zooming and playback and the battery meter still showed about 25% charge remaining.Pro'sZoom - very long for a subcompact camera 20x optical, total 81x combined (yes 81 times!)Image Stabilizer - Excellent (far superior than the DSC-HX9V); Even at 81x the picture did not come out of focus, but of course not as sharp. I think it's still acceptableScenes - A few scenes; I think the portrait, sepia, B/W works real well (the Portrait+ suppose to blur the picture a bit, but it's not to my liking) It has a few effects (fish eye, toy, miniature) that's very effective and can be fun for creative shots.Auto Mode - was able to pick the correct type of scene almost all the time; it has an easy mode, and smart auto. Not sure why they have an easy mode, but the smart auto works greatSize/Weight - very compact and weigh's 8.2 oz. I would have prefer if the lens was flushed with the unit, but at 20x it may not have been possibleUniformity - the unit does not feel cheap, and beautifully curved; no sharp jagged cornersGrip - the right side of the camera has a nice plastic strip for easier gripControls - Dial extremely easy to use with one hand. The other buttons, if you're a previous Canon user, it's a no brainer; the menu and setup are practically the same across all their models.Screen - 3 inch TFT LCD screen very beautiful; nuff saidProcessor - Didn't notice that much difference between the DIGIC 4/DIGIC 5, but compared to the DSC-HX9V, this camera is like a Ferrari.GPS - Camera has it, but I never used it and probably won't; at least for the time being. Am more interested in a camera that takes excellent pictureCon'sVideo - compared to the Sony DSC-HX9V this Canon comes in a distant second; if you plan on using this primarily as a video recorder, look elsewhere. I think Sony has excellent lens on their camera but their processing technology is clumsy, painfully slow and unacceptable; whereas with taking videos, the Sony does not do any processing (not to mention it captures at 60fps compared to Canon's 24/25 fps) This is one thing I will miss dearly.Flash - not sure if there is a good place but I had to change my grip as the flash is on the top left corner. Couple of times, I had my left index finger on the flash and the camera gave some flash error message and had to power off and power on the camera to reset the flash.If you're a casual or intermittent photographer (or a professional wanting an everyday point and shoot camera without carrying a luggage everywhere) that is interested in looking for a well refined point and shoot camera, yet has manual controls usually found on higher end DSLR (or higher end point and shoot camera), this is it!UPDATE 04/14/2012 - I paid $349 and today I noticed it's selling for $299, a 15% price drop in less than a month!

Unboxing was pretty quick and painless. Im sure most have mentioned there is no ""power block"", just a USB cable. You can get a 50% discount on it at time of purchase IF you go through amazon. More about this later.Setting the devices up was easy for the most part. I have no idea why no one sets the interface up to show you the MAC when connecting to an AP (access point). [The MAC might be needed if your filtering clients on your wireless network by MAC address] I have to forgo setting the device up then find the MAC and backtrack to set the device up. Other than that it seems fine. I do notice that when in FreeTime app that when I move from one wireless network to another it doesn't pick up automatically, more on this later.The tablet is very responsive. I'm quite impressed. Everything is fluid and gives me a good feeling about using it. I don't feel like I'm waiting on the device to catch up with my movements.Freetime and Freetime Unlimited are the reasons I went with the Kindle Fire HD, that and the ability to access the children videos for my kids in my Amazon acct.The Freetime app is nice. Its simply clean. You set a password on the app and then at launch the app simply gives access to only which Apps, Videos and Books you choose. No browser although you can start a search and hit the Amazon page. There is no option for Music which makes both sense and no sense. It would be REALLY nice to see a Music option also and to allow the option to allow music by artist, album, song, etc just like you can sort with the amazon music store/player.Freetime Unlimited is a good start at something great. This is supposed to allow access to a slew of apps, videos and books geared towards children so as a parent we will feel safe with them accessing anything on the tablet (Freetime). Most of the content seems to be age appropriate but there were titles in the apps, games and videos I didn't want my children to access. My wife, who has a Masters Degree in Reading (I wont go on about her list of credentials but simply I am VERY proud of her) said some of the content wasn't age appropriate and/or had no educational value for the children. Keep in mind though, this is a new feature and it will most likely get better from here. I would like to see Music added though. I would like to be able to add music content by album, artist, song title, etc from my library. It would be nice to see content added along with the Unlimited plan like Imagination Movers, Fresh Beat Band, etc. that the kids could just play on their own. One thing that I have not been able to do is to delete content included in Unlimited, or at least disable it from being seen. This would be a work around (not a solution) for the content we don't want our children to be exposed to.This is something extra for Amazon to read. If we put in our children's ages I really think the content should be geared towards that age group. Its nice to have some fun material too but if a child is given this device as a pacifier then wouldn't it be nice for them to be able to actually practice things they should be working on in their age group? My wife would be a great addition to your team to help you determine what titles are age appropriate, its what she does for a living :-)About the wireless in Freetime. It seems to have a hard time moving from one network to another sometimes. I think it should connect flawlessly just like a regular tablet does or maybe its just how the Kindle Fire series handles moving from one network to another. Sometimes it says it needs to login and it brings up the Amazon site. It would be REALLY nice if this could be scripted to to be done in the background for Freetime so trusted networks will automatically connect without user (children) interaction.I ordered the ""power block"", a HDMI cable, an Amazon Basics bag for the kids to keep their tablets in and the Marware case (it was a hard choice between the Amazon case but this one was a bit cheaper although has less features). They love them, I strongly suggest getting the Amazon Basics bag. I installed Zagg's standard shield (i hear the HD shields are thinner and not as good). The shields look great and you cant tell they are there when your looking at them. I install these shields on everything, even on gorilla glass devices. It gives a good feel, less mess from oily fingers in my opinion and you don't cringe everything the device rubs across a scratchy surface. Well worth the money.Bottom line is the Kindle Fire HD 7"" is a great purchase for my children. It has been a bit of an expensive but a worthwhile investment. The Freetime Unlimited app has proven to be a great investment also. If you don't see the books, games, videos you want your child to have then you can simply purchase the content and give them access to it on a per item basis. I ordered a camera app for them to play with it, they love to record themselves making funny faces and noises.",How is the model?,[],[],[],[],[]

Unlike the 3.5"" hard drive world, capacities are larger earlier in the external devices, but somehow the casing and enclosed bridge (in this case SATA to USB) make the physical size larger than an internal drive with case.  This one is still a little bigger, but really quite small.  It's awesome, frankly.  To have that much capacity in something you can store just about anywhere and you don't even have to mess around with a power cord.What I don't like - and I complain about this with all external hard drives - is the included software that they want you to install to do backups, etc.  As an advanced computer user, I think it's nonsense; even my mother should be able to use the drive without any software.  Of course you don't have to use it.  The thing that annoys me is that the drive - again, like all other externals nowadays - comes with a sleep timer set, in this case at 30 minutes, so I have to install the interface software to turn that off (necessary for my intended application), and then uninstall the software to get it off my system, but all software leaves a trace after its removal.If this is your first USB 3.0 peripheral, be aware that the port on the drive is unlike any USB 2.0 port, and thus will require a different cable if you need one longer than the included ~1m cable.  More industry stupidity, so they can overcharge for the first year or so.  Look for a cheap one on Amazon so you don't have to run out to Best Buy and pay 10x too much.  Interface cables are the one thing I believe in buying as cheap as possible - and thank God for Amazon in that respect.One more note in response to another review:  prices on non-solid state hard drives have been fluctuating a lot recently because of the Thai floods, and prices of electronics on Amazon always fluctuate.  I typically check all prices before buying anything, but still end up buying from Amazon 99% of the time.  I haven't seen Best Buy have a real deal in years.  They make their money off lies that their employees tell you, either because they have been brainwashed in to believing said lies or because of commission.  Do your own price comparison when the time comes to make a purchase.The only thing I don't love about this drive is an industry problem that's not going away any time soon, and I have to just stop complaining about it (later).  I give this a higher than average review because I was actually surprised - and impressed - with the physical size.",Does this provide enough storage?,[],[],[],[],[]

Don't get me wrong, I love this little camera. The AF is insanely fast and accurate and the image quality is great. Here is the list of pros and cons I could come up with.Pros:- Super fast AF. Around the same speed as my Nikon D7000 and probably more accurate. It almost never missed focus.- Lightweight and small. Other have said with the pancake lens it will fit in your pants pocket. They must have really big pockets. There's no way I can fit it with the pancake lens on into a jean pocket. A jacket pocket sure, but not my pants.- Weather sealing!- Touch screen. This is an awesome feature. I can give my wife the camera and tell her to tap the screen on someones face and it takes the picture perfectly in focus.- Lots of lenses to choose from.- Image quality is really good.- Low light noise is pretty amazing for a sensor this small. If you're showing pics on the web, ISO 1600 and 3200 look great and I don't hesitate to use either. ISO 25600 is a marketing trick, it looks like my son drew a water color painting, ISO 12800 isn't great either.- It's built like a tank- The electronic viewfinder is a really nice addition although it's not as nice as an optical viewfinder on any DSLR I've ever used.- Large high quality LCD on the back- Battery life is very good. I took around 300 shots over a three day period and it was still at 3/4 full battery.- The way they positioned the two command dials works perfectly. The thumb and pointer finger rest on both allowing easy access to changing settings.Neutral:- The menu system is neither great nor terrible it just takes some getting used to.- The Buttons are mushy feeling and very small. The camera is small so it's kind of what I expected.Cons:- The included external flash is really weird. It's this tiny little thing you have to carry around in a pouch and it's really awkward to attach it to the camera. They should have just moved the viewfinder over to the side and put a flash in the camera with a hotshoe on top. It's a direct flash and doesn't allow you to pull it back and bounce it. I probably won't use it much if at all.- It's bit hard to firmly hold if you have big hands. I'm always afraid I'm going to drop it if I hold it with 1 hand. The grip could be improved.- The metal strap connectors are in a weird place and you have to put them in between your fingers to grip the camera.- The price was a little hard for me to swallow. For what you get it's probably the right price but it's still a lot of money.- This camera does not give DSLR quality images. I can easily spot any pic from my D7000 over a pic from the Olympus. The images are fantastic, don't get my wrong. But the look of the pictures from the camera is a little flatter and less 3 dimensional than a DSLR. It's hard to explain but the bigger sensor in bigger cameras does make a difference in image quality.Final ThoughtsYes the image quality is fantastic but for me this camera does not replace my Nikon D7000. Pictures from my Nikon just look slightly more realistic and have more pop to them. I bought this camera because I hate lugging my DSLR around. It's big and bulky and I never take it hiking or fishing with me. I wanted something that had close to DSLR quality images but in a tiny package I could carry everywhere. I wanted fast and accurate AF and I wanted it to be easy enough for my wife to use. I also wanted interchangeable lenses. With the Olympus I got everything I asked for. No it's not a DSLR replacement like I had hoped it would be. I wouldn't shoot weddings with this camera. Both types of cameras have their place and this little Olympus has found the perfect place into my bag.",How is the image quality?,['The images are fantastic'],[2814],[1],[0.9],[ True]

I've always bought whatever was on sale, even though I consider myself an audiophile (I've just never had the extra money to spend).I got a hold of these headphones, and they just completely blew me away!The sound fidelity is unbelievable.

It produces a very well balanced sound which is very pleasant to listen to.These are open headphones, so they don't suffocate your ears. I do not get listening fatigue nor do my ears get sore after listening for over two hours. They are very comfortable, breathe well but produce an outstanding sound.I listen to mostly hard rock, some country and classical.

I have also owned and used in the past the Logitech Review using GoogleTV, the last two non-Google TV Sony boxes, and two generations of the WD TV Live streamers. After owning and using all those, the Roku is the only one that has a place in my livingroom, and here's why...Without boring everyone on the specs of the R's, let me start by telling about my experience setting it up.Once unpacked one simply plugs the power adapter into the wall and an HDMI cable into the TV and the Roku, that's it. The unit begins booting up then asks you to select whether you want to use a wireless or wired network connection. I selected wireless and it then shows a list of the networks it detected. Once you choose your network you input the password for your network and in a few seconds it connects right away.Finally it displays an activation code which you are to use to activate and attach the Roku to your online Roku account. For some seeking out a computer that may or may not be near the TV might be a pain, but I simply opened Safari on my iPhone and added the code to my account while sitting in front of the TV.Once the code is entered, as part of the attaching process you are prompted to add payment info just in case you want to buy a channel or game in the future. You can not bypass this but IT'S OK. Enter it in and finish the account set up. Once you do you can simply choose to delete the payment info and it's erased from the Roku servers.Once the account is made and successfully linked, the Roku automatically downloads the channels from your account (if you are attaching it to an existing account) or just quickly downloads the few selected during the account creation process, including ""Angry Birds Space"".That's it, its that easy to get it set and ready to stream. Of course with some premium channels you will either need to log in to your account from the Roku (Netflix) or similarly link the box to your online account using a computer, smartphone, or tablet browser (Amazon Instant Video).I have found that the set up is incredibly easy over the numerous boxes I've used over the last few years and always recommend a Roku to especially those less adept at setting up electronics/computers/networking items.The interface--The interface of the Roku units has always been a sore point.. When it started out with just Netflix and then just a few channels, the horizontal row of channel icons was fine, but now with HUNDREDS of channels it was sorely needing a refresh. The interface alone was one of the biggest reasons I was always trying different streaming boxes..I'm so pleased to see the new grid-style interface on the R3. Not only is it beautifully rendered, but it is very, very fast to navigate and to find whatever it is you want in your channel list. Very modern-looking and functional.One huge thing I notice over the older units in the interface is that besides it being ""pretty"", even the channels load much faster than previous units thanks to a new processor.The universal search function is great too, allowing you to search for movies, shows, and even actors across the major providers.The USB port--USB functionality is a great add-on for the top tier Roku. The Roku units are first and foremost internet streamers, but the convenience of plugging in a thumb drive and being able to play some of my personal movie collection is great. Video format is rather limited, but again this is an add-on feature not a main selling point. Because I'm an iTunes user, I rip all my movies/shows as H.264 MP4 files because thy are iPhone/iPad compatible, and just so happen they are compatible with Roku as well. Very nice.Programming----This is where Roku is just second to none, and why I choose to use it over all the others. Besides the big players like Netflix, Vudu, etc. Roku has such a wealth of programming that I actually hate it. I hate the fact I'm not independently wealthy and have to work for a living, and consequently don't have enough time in the day to watch everything on there I want to. You may very well feel the same way, but not to worry.. Unlike broadcast TV, everything on Roku is on-demand, meaning its there when you want it, not when its being broadcast.Now sure, there's no YouTube. That might or might not be coming so if you get one, just assume you won't have it. Cute little kitty videos are fun to watch on the TV, but there's tons more you can watch on other channels. I love the fact I can get live streaming news from the BBC or CNN International, or watch cheesy, badly dubbed Kung fu movies, or B-movie horror and sci-fi all night long for free from my Roku if I want lol. The Roku's available programming really is like a buffet, its all you can eat and there's something for everybody.The remote ---The remote is very comfortable in the hands and acts as a motion-controlled controller for gaming. It it also isn't infared like a traditional remote so that means it doesn't have to be pointed right at the TV in order to work. The private listening mode worked really nicely when I tried it and I can imagine many uses for it.Overall the Roku 3 is a great upgrade from the previous Roku 2, mostly because of the new UI (which will be coming to the roku 2 units in a month or two), the faster processor, and the wireless private listening mode. If you already have an R2 XS, I don't honestly think its worth upgrading since its biggest noticeable feature (the UI) will come in time.For some just now dipping their toes in the world of internet streaming, I personally would get this Roku 3 hands-down over any other competing player on the market. Its so easy to use and that's why not only is it what I use but what my elderly parents use too. The best thing about them is they keep getting better.",How is the deal?,[],[],[],[],[]

I know I will not be in a position to take full advantage of this router's features for a while because most of my devices lack 5GHz capability but in spite of that there is  no doubt it will help overall network performance. While it appears to be positioned at the modest end of the manufacturer's dual band router product line, there is nothing modest about its' usefulness.Using the resource mini-cd for the setup assistant application, basic installation was completed in less than ten minutes, not factoring in the number of individual devices I needed to reconfigure to identify the new SSID(s) and password(s).  In order to create guest networking, a firmware update from the TP-LINK's website has to be installed. It should be noted the downloaded files must be extracted using WinZip or WinRAR, which might encumber some casual users. If the intention is to continue to use the Assistant app, there also appears to be another firmware update required to coincide with the other the other firmware modifications, as I discovered when I lost connectivity and couldn't restore it via the CD copy.  I didn't download it as I have enough familiarity with router configuration that I had already decided to log onto the administrative page and make manual changes before I realized there was a fix available.With theoretical transfer rates up to 300Mbps over both the 2.4GHZ and 5GHZ bands which results in the published combined rate of 600Mbps,  the router has already proven to be a nice step forward for my home/ home office network even though most of my activity will remain on the lower bandwidth at `g' standard. With two detachable external antennas, I would rate overall signal strength as good but not outstanding over 2.4GHZ. On the alternate band, degradation to some problematic areas in my house was evident (and expected) yet tolerable without with use of a range extender or access point.On a laptop where I swapped the existing adapter for a dual band `n' standard adapter I experienced an immediate consistent increase from the customary 36 to 46Mbps I was used to to 84Mbps via 5GHZ. That will be beneficial for streaming music and video files and networked backups to and from my media server and NAS. I'm sure most users will also be aware the 5GHZ band will only be visible on devices with dual band adapter capability and network names have to be segregated. As expected, WAN transferal over either band was not improved significantly as ISP limitations come into play there although there did appear to be a slight improvement as interference from other networks in my area is minimal on the 5GHz band.Naturally, some of us want caviar at catfish prices so it would have been great if the router had gigabit ethernet ports but it does have a USB port for networking printers and storage devices , freeing up another ethernet port for another device. It also has a power switch, a convenience absent on many devices in this price range, and  wireless on/off switch which is convenient for disabling broadcasts when one is away but needs to leave the network running for some processes like scheduled backups to a networked storage device.One interesting thing was I swapped out my normal adapters for the TP-LINK WDN 3200 thinking paired products from the same manufacturer might marginally improve performance but it turned out the opposite was true. On a laptop and older desktop PC, signal strength was actually lessened by 20% I tend to believe that may be attributable to the adapters lack of external antenna. I did not try the USB type adapter with an external cord which could have impacted results by facilitating different angles.",Does the mouse have good options?,[],[],[],[],[]

It was delivered 4 days earlier than expected. As always, you can't go wrong by shopping at Amazon. When I first unpacked LG Infinia LW5600, I was so pleased at the aesthetics. I hadn't actually seen one in person and was amazed at how sleek looking the front was, and how incredibly thin this television is. It's amazingly about 1"" thick. It has a nice swivel base, which I love. At this point I wasn't going to mount it on the wall, but given it's incredibly thin profile, I would some day; it would look awesome on a wall. It was easy to mount on the base, and the television is light enough, a strong enough person could do it without help. I didn't have any problem. I turned it on went through the easy to follow initial setup. Easy Easy Easy to set up, and connect to a home network via WIFI.This set has more bells and whistles than you'll ever need, some being really cool. It has the standard stuff like Netflix, Pandora, Youtube, and even Facebook. It also has a web browser that allows you to brows the web just like you would on your computer. Pretty cool on a 55"" HD screen. The web browser even has some nice tools such as Favorites. There are Apps, just like you would find on a smart phone; some free and some for purchase. The ""magic wand"" remote is pretty cool, with it's Wii like function of just point at the TV, move the cursor over an item, and click. In other words, when you hear the term ""feature rich"" this TV certainly is.The passive 3D is pretty cool, although I don't have a 3D blue ray movie in my collection yet. The 2D to 3D conversion is surprisingly pretty cool and pretty well done. With the conversion feature, you won't get things popping out of the screen, but it does add depth to the picture, sort of like watching real life through a 55"" window. The glasses are very comfortable, to the point I forgot I had them on. You can walk around the house with them on and they do not hinder your vision. However, I did notice, with the passive 3D, you can't get to far off center from the picture because you'll get a lot of crosstalk. I did view some true 3D content in the apps section, which did have things popping right out of the screen. I was impressed with the 3D.The BadFirst let me say, I'm crushed this TV didn't live up to what is could be. I wanted to keep it so badly, mostly because if it's awesome features, and the sleek look. Then I started actually watching television. It was all uphill from there. Let's just point out the very poor sound quality form the speakers. I expected that. You can't expect theatre sound from a TV that's an inch thick, or any other flat screen TV for that matter. I also noticed, very distinctly, what some are calling the ""Soap Opera Effect"". It makes the picture, no matter what the source, BluRay, Cable, Netflix, etc... look like it was filmed on a home video camera. It's very odd and hard to explain, but it's like watching a low budget public access show that can't afford the really expensive professional video cameras and lighting they use to make Hollywood movies. Grab your video camera, go out in your back yard, and film your family, then watch it on your TV. That's what all programming looks like on the TV; even Avatar looked like it was filmed informally with a cheap camera, even though in HD. To be honest, at times, it was pretty interesting to see things in that perspective, but mostly it gets annoying because you never see anything as it was intended by the director. In other words, it's a huge drawback, but not the biggest.The biggest drawback is the different aspects of the horrible picture quality. First, let me explain, this ain't my first rodeo. I've owned plasma and LCD TVs, ranging from 40"" to 50"". So setting up a good picture is something I'm quite familiar with. I spent three days tweaking the settings in this TV, trying to get the colors, brightness, etc... where I like it. It seemed to get one thing right, I had to sacrifice another. Finally I just settled by saying it's not the best, but I could probably live with it, although it still ticked me off. Of the poor picture quality issues, this wasn't the worst. The worst and complete deal breaker was the incredible amount of motion blur and shuttering you get from this set. It's horribly intolerable, even to the point of causing horrible eye strain. This is in regular 2D mode, mind you. The ""True Motion"" feature is useless. In fact even LG Support suggests you turn it off. After the first couple of days of trying to get rid of the juddering effect, I called LG customer support and got a tech on the line. He said I'd have to switch the AV mode to GAME mode. This helped some, but only some. The motion blur and juddering were still intolerable, and what you gained by using GAME mode, you lost by adding a ghosting effect around any moving objects on the screen. The LG tech said, and I quote, ""if that didn't fix it, that's just how the picture is then."" Anyway, what's the point of having different ""Modes"" if you can only use GAME Mode? Didn't matter anyway, it still didn't solve the problem.In the end, the TV is sitting in my guest bedroom now, all packed up, and waiting for the shipping company to pick it back up to return it to Amazon. I went to Walmart yesterday and purchased a 60"" Panasonic 2D Plasma they have on sale for $898 This set was awesome right out of the box as soon as I turned it on. I spent less than 10 minutes tweaking the picture settings and I'm done. It's awesome every time now. I really wanted to love the LG set, but unfortunately there's no getting around the fact that you purchase a television to enjoy watching it, and this set did nothing but frustrate and annoy me. I wouldn't recommend it. You still can't beat a plasma TV for picture quality.",Do you have a limited choice?,[],[],[],[],[]

The thin profile of the TV makes it very difficult to access and modify cables once its wall mounted. The USB ports are definitely inaccessible once the TV is mounted (recommending plugging in a USB extender cable ahead of time)**I got an ultra-thin wall mount and since there's barely 1inch clearance behind the TV you HAVE to dismount the TV in order to modify cable connections, unless you have a retractable wall mount I don't think its possible to make any cable modifications without dismounting the TV.

The keys have a really nice feel to them.  It is small because it is the width of the iPad, but it is still very functional.  I really like the extra function buttons (home, brightness adjustment, volume adjustment, copy, paste, and media conrols.  I find myself using the volume controls a lot - much better than finding the right side of the iPad with the controls and hitting the wrong one by mistake!  I am typing this review on the keyboard and it is working really well.  I havee also used the keyyboard forr several hours and have not neeededd to charge it once yet.Case/StandThe case overall is very sturdy.  It has a nice solid, slightly heavy feel to it.  I assume the weight is due to the battery.  The case closes tightly and has a nice latch to keep it closed.  Another positive with the case is that it is very configurable.  There are a lot of different orientations that you can place the iPad in (portrait, landscape, folded over on top of the keyboard).  There is a groove at the top of the keyboard for resting the iPad in so it doesn't move when you touch it.  Unfortunately, I have found it slightly awkward to get the iPad in the groove because it requires sliding a latch on the back of the keyboard and pulling the stand part of the case sligtly out of the keyboard.My favorite way to use the case is on a table.  I pull the iPad and stand completely out of the keyboard and place it several inches behind the keyboard.  It makes it very easy to sit down and knock out some emails withough having to use the on-screen keyboard.  It is very handy to be able to remove the iPad but keep the stand attached, without needing the keyboard.  I have used it several times this way as well.The case also has the ability to detach the iPad from the keyboard and stand entirely.  It is very quick and easy to remove it by using a camera lens cap type of connector.  The iPad itself sits in a thin plastic case that wraps around the sides and back of the iPad.  it's not incredibly protective and I'm not sure how it would handle a drop, but it's much better than no case and does offer scratch protection for the back of the iPad.OverallThis case works well as a case for a family iPad.  It can be used with the keyboard for doing text-intensive work, then with just the stand for watching videos or playing games.  It's also quick to pop off of both to hand it to the kids to use, while still offering some protection.  The keyboard feels and works great and the case is solid and very adjustable, with just a few small quirks",How is the case?,"['KeyboardThe keyboard on this case is very nice'

I've been using this specific brand of headphones for about 12 years now, and I refuse to buy another brand or style.It started about 25 years ago, when I was living with my parents, and I had a pair of headphones that I absolutely LOVED! About 10 or so years ago, I wanted to try and find another pair just like them, so I went searching.I finally realized that the pair I used when I was younger were called Porta-Pro, also made by Koss. However, those are a little more expensive and I didn't really like the way they felt on my head. Maybe it's my big head, but they just felt too tight. So, somebody recommended these, and I just fell in love with them.The are very comfortable - even for my big head. It's almost like you're not even wearing headphones. I like the design, and the soft, blue material on top is comfortable resting on your head. Also, the volume control is very convenient. I always use it as opposed to the volume on my MP3 player or computer now.The only negative is that - since they are so inexpensive - they are made of cheaper materials, and my two boys (ages 9 and 11) have torn up a few. Usually, the jack gets shorted out and one, or both, of the speakers stop working. This could easily be fixed with some solder and an iron, but since they're so cheap, I usually just buy another pair. Also, the pads tend to wear down over time, but that's to be expected. You can purchase an extra set of pads as a backup, which I did.As for the sound? It's great. There is a lot of bass response in the phones, and the volume can get pretty loud. The sound is also very clear, and I would compare the audio quality to $100 headphones I've owned in the past.I highly recommend the KTX-Pro1 headphones by Koss. These are hands down the best value for a headphone under $20. Trust me, you won't go wrong with these cans.",What is the quality of the pair?,[],[],[],[],[]

I need another bluetooth speaker for a second car, so I tried T505.Good: The sound of T505 is better than T325 (without using FM broadcasting). It's not louder, but the sound quality is better in mid- to high-frequency. T325 is more on low-frequency sound, which mixes into road and wind noises.Bad: After using T505 for a week I realized how much T325 has been improved on human interface from T305/T505. T325 has auto connect, big call button, and can speak names when a call arrives. T505 has stiff and small buttons, don't do auto connect, and can only speak telephone numbers. As for voice dialing, T505's sound is tiny; it's hard to hear to whom the phone is dialing to. Voice dialing is not very reliable on both T325 and T505, but with T325 I know to whom it's calling and can stop it if the calling name is wrong.FM broadcasting: Only T505 has this feature. The sound is pretty good. However, it searches for a free FM frequency whenever it powers on. That means the frequency always changes. For this reason, it's extremely troublesome to use this feature. I guess if I don't turn T505 off, it's less an issue. However, I don't like the idea of having a tiny FM broadcasting station working over my head all the time. :-)So I decided to return it, and probably will get another T325 or the roadster.",How do you want the volume?,[],[],[],[],[]

Getting the new flagship model every three or four years was something I did for a long time, but when D-SLRs came along, I began downsizing after the EOS 1Ds I got in 2004. In 2007 I moved to EOS 40D and, although losing the full-size sensor was a sacrifice, it was a step in the right direction. With my recent purchase of the T3i, it's another move away from the professional models.Why would I do that? It's not so much the cost of new cameras that has shaped my decisions to downgrade; it's the size. While professional equipment is important to me, so are professional looking photos. And the truth is, after the newness wears off a D-SLR, I tend frequently to leave the big gun behind and rely on an advanced compact or ultrazoom for most of my shooting. As a result, I have more point-and-shoot pictures than I do pro quality ones.This tendency has ended with the purchase of the T3i. The camera is modestly sized, and I never leave home without it. With the 18-55mm kit lens (very nice little lens for its specs) or 24-105L, it's not any bigger than the Fuji Finepix HS10 I leaned on for most of my shooting this past year. And while the HS10 is hands down the best ultrazoom camera I ever used, the difference in image quality, performance and even video between it and the T3i is night and day.The T3i may not be blazing fast like my 1Ds or the 40D, but 90% of the shooting I do is not that kind of photography, anyway. What the T3i excels at is image quality. I have a whole raft of photos that, eked and tweaked to maximum effect in Photoshop, are only a little better than average because they were taken with a point-and-shoot camera. This camera's image quality, I'm happy to say, is superlative! So are the videos. Rebel T3i is almost too good to be true.An articulating LCD is something I've come to insist upon, and this one is by far the best I've ever used. I don't use Live View every time, but I've certainly been in that mode a lot more frequently with this model than with the 40D! In review mode, the refresh rate is a bit slow when zooming in to look at details, but it's not as slow as reviewing pictures on, say, Panasonic DMC-ZS7. (I did test Canon EOS 60D at Best Buy and noticed that the refresh rate is much faster on that model--perhaps because of the larger battery--but it's really not enough of an issue to deduct a star.)The resolution of the LCD is superb, and because it can be tilted and twisted to advantage, it can be viewed even in strong sunlight.Although the nine-point autofocus system is getting criticism for lagging behind Nikon, focus is swift and accurate. At 3.7 fps, burst mode is cut nearly in half from my 40D's 6.5 fps, but so far this has not hampered my ability to catch fast moving subjects.I appreciate the Lighting Optimizer function and use it a lot under the harsh lighting conditions in the desert where I live. It is of incalculable value.I have yet to haul out the owner's manual, thanks to the on-board guide. Of course it helps that I've owned Canon D-SLRs before, but adjusting settings on this camera is a lot different than on my previous ones. There have been some settings I would have normally needed to consult a manual for, but it hasn't been necessary because the answers are in-camera. (I never shoot in Auto, by the way. I'm a manual mode kinda gal.)Because images are very clean up to ISO 1600 and are usable even at ISO 6400, taking along the Speedlight flash so far has not been necessary. Yet another plus with this Canon iteration.There's something about blown highlights that really sets my teeth on edge, but that has not been a problem, thanks to the T3i's Highlight Tone Priority function. Dynamic range is very good to excellent, even a hair better than my 40D. Colors are more accurate, too. I prefer the contrast one stop under the camera's default setting, which is, admittedly, fairly punchy and will result in a blown highlight here and there. Reducing contrast just a tad fixes that.Eighteen megapixel resolution is outstanding.Sometimes I think about the EOS 60D's speedier performance, more advanced autofocus system and that wonderful electronic level and wonder if I made the right choice. But then I remember the heft and bulk of that camera and all the times I've left my SLR at home for those very reasons, and I know the T3i was the right decision. I really, really like this new camera--and I take it everywhere!",How is the autofocus?,[],[],[],[],[]

I liked the size of the Fire but I felt that the operating system on it was too limited.  I decided the Galaxy Tab 2 7"" looked right for the price.  It's $50 more expensive than the Fire and $450 cheaper than my 64GB iPad 3.  The screen is not as clear or bright as the iPad 3 and the video quality isn't as good as the Kindle Fire but I would say that it is not too bad.  Don't expect excellent video quality because it's not but you can't expect all the bells and whistles of a high end tablet for only $250.  I like the android ice cream sandwich OS.  It looks nice on this device and it's a lot different than Amazon's version of android OS on the Kindle Fire.  The interface is fairly smooth and intuitive.  I haven't really had much delay when tapping on icons or sliding the screen.  It's not quite as smooth and sensitive as the iPad but let's face it, if you are interested in buying the Galaxy Tab 2 7"" it is probably for the price and you have ruled out the iPad for that reason or because maybe you have one already.  I think the camera isn't too bad considering the Kindle Fire doesn't even have one.  It is front and back.  There is 8GB of internal memory with an expandable slot for up to 32GB micro SD card.  That is a plus over the Fire.  I find it easy to put music and movies onto the micro SD card, then put the card in the Galaxy Tab and it very quickly loads all of it onto the device to play.  Easier than using the iTunes software if you ask me.  The speakers on the Galaxy Tab are not as clear and crisp or even as loud as the iPad 3 but it gets loud enough for my taste.  The sound is better and louder with headphones.  With headphones it sounds pretty good.  The Galaxy Tab 2 is more portable than the iPad because if you don't carry a bag of some sort to put it in you can still fit it in your front pocket.  You wont be able to put much else in that pocket and it sticks out but you certainly can't do that with the iPad.  As far as android play store, I am new to it.  I'm used to iTunes but there are many of the same apps available on the play store.  There is a Kindle app so you can still read your ebooks.  As far as I can tell there is no way to play Amazon VOD for Prime members or otherwise.  You also can't really sync your iTunes purchases to the Galaxy Tab 2 either.  There are work arounds that allow you to put iTunes movies and music on the Tab but if that is something that interests you, you can always look that up.  Surfing the web is easy and you can use firefox or opera if you want.  I have read some reviews that say surfing the web on this tablet is slow but I have no found that to be the case.  Web pages don't load quite as fast as the iPad but they load pretty quickly.  I also read reviews about how the wifi connection isn't as strong on this device as it is on other tablets.  That appears to be the case but it really hasn't resulted in slow internet speeds for me; and my internet provider doesn't provide me with very good upload and download speeds.  Overall for the price I would say this is a good tablet.  You can get a few cellphones like the Samsung Galaxy Note or the upcoming SIII for $200-$250 that are like this tablet but with better specs.  However, that is the price you pay if you have an upgrade available otherwise without an upgrade you will pay retail of $500-$550.  I think that even the Galaxy Note's 5.3"" screen is a bit too small for a tablet though.  The 7"" screen is just right for an extra-portable tablet.  I would recommend the Galaxy Tab 2 7"".  You can wait until July when supposedly a 7"" Google Asus tablet will be released for $200.  It is supposed to have better specs.  Just FYI.",What is the user interface like?,[],[],[],[],[]

Always at the forefront of computer-human relations has been the keyboard and mouse (at least in my lifetime). It's no surprise then to see just how many companies try year after year to perfect this interface.Microsoft's effort with the Wireless Desktop 3000 is a noble effort worthy of praise.So in a nutshell here is what I like:Keyboard:+ Very stylish looking.+ A subtle contour that feels just right when typing.+ They keys are a cross between a standard desktop and a laptop keyboard. The keys make a satisfying ""click-clap"" when typing.+ WIRELESS! Say goodbye to those messy wires and hello to a clean desktop!+ 2 extra USB ports freed up (thanks to the wonders of wireless technology)!+ Integrated wrist-rest made from a soft-rubbery type of material.+ Plenty of integrated and customizable shortcuts to everything from email, calculator and multi-media functions.Mouse:+ Again stylish looking - I'm a sucker for Blue LED's of any type!+ Rubberized grips on the sides of the mouse are very comfortable.+ Integrated ""back"" & ""forward"" buttons are placed perfectly.+ Scroll wheel is heavy and super-smooth.+ Clicking the scroll wheel brings up a super-cool way to switch between apps - think Alt+Tab but better looking.+ The BlueTrack technology in the mouse is supposed to work on just about anything but glass or mirrored surfaces. In my experience this is true - except of course I can't throw away my mouse pad just yet as I have a glass-top desk.There are a few things that I don't like:Keyboard:- The ""function"" keys are small and evenly spaced across the top of the keyboard. This makes finding a specific 'Fx' key challenging.- No back-lighting whatsoever - obviously to save power but still.- Installing the included software does add more functions but takes an absurd amount of time for install - think more than 15 minutes! This is a keyboard and mouse not anti-virus software!I was a bit worried when I read that this combo operates in the 2.4GHz spectrum. I run a wireless network in my home and can pick up 6 different networks in my area. My fears of interruptions have thus far been unfounded. Everything works swimmingly! The keyboard and mouse each take 2 'AA' batteries and I've been using the same rechargeable batteries in mine for the past 2 months without a hiccup. According to Microsoft I should be able to squeeze out 12 months out of my batteries - we'll see.",How do you like the need?,[],[],[],[],[]

I loved the Fire, but it was a bit clunky in some tasks, and it sadly lacked some desirable hardware features. I'm happy to say that I've had my Kindle Fire HD for a few hours, and my initial impressions are very positive. Clearly, Amazon listened to customers and addressed many of their comments. For starters:1. There's an external volume control. This was my single biggest gripe with the original Fire.2. There's a built-in microphone. That means you can Skype and use cool apps like Soundhound and Shazam. With the front-facing camera, you can do video Skyping, which is a big plus. The lack of a microphone or mic input was my second biggest gripe with the original Fire.3. An HDMI port means you can connect your Fire HD directly to most TV sets. I have a Roku, so that's not as big of a deal to me, but the HDMI puts the Fire HD out in front of almost every other tablet. I definitely want to try streaming Amazon instant video to a hotel TV the next time I travel.4. The video is noticeably crisper for videos.5. Bluetooth is a great new feature. It opens the possibility of wirelessly connecting the Fire HD to a myriad of products. I've been using a small, portable Bluetooth speaker to amplify my original Fire's sound. That works, but only with a cable connecting the Fire and the speaker. With the Fire HD, it only took a minute to activate the Bluetooth, find the speaker, and pair it with the Fire HD.6. The sound quality is very noticeably better. So far I haven't encountered an MP3 or video where I had to strain to hear, and oftentimes I'm having to back down on the volume.7. The web browser appears to be a little faster, although I won't really know how much faster until I upgrade my wireless router to a newer, dual band model. The wi-fi reception is quite good. When I connected the HD to our home network, the HD detected ten other networks in near-by houses, which is more than our laptop PC can detect.8. In the original Fire, using the graphic handles to select text was awkward and not always very responsive, especially with text in emails. The HD appears to have improved considerably the ease of selecting text.9. Unlike the original Fire, the memory is not partitioned, so it appears you can use all the user-available memory (12.63 GB) for anything - books, video, music, photos, etc. This is a big improvement.10. The virtual keyboard has been restored to something closer to the original Fire. Once again, there are separate periods and commas, so you don't have to hold down the period to type a comma. This was a real improvement.11. Text-to-Speech for books has returned to the HD. There aren't any settings - the voice is either on or off, and there's only a female voice - but it sounds more like a human voice and less like a computer than before.The HD was delivered already registered to me, so about all I had to do was connect with my wi-fi, set up my Gmail account (less than one minute) and set my favorites for the web browser, then download some of my books, magazines, videos, and apps from the Cloud. With 8GB of memory in the original Fire, I often had to delete apps before downloading any new apps. With 16GB in the Fire HD, that's much less critical.Because the size is different and the controls and ports have been moved around, cases for the original Kindle Fire won't work. The padded envelope sleeve that I had for the original Kindle Fire does work, although it's not a perfect fit.One annoyance: the Kindle Fire HD displays color advertisements on its lock screen, so every time you turn on the HD, you see advertisements for a Kindle e-book, a video, Amazon MP3 music, and such. Amazon has announced that owners can opt-out of the ads for $15. After using the HD for a few days, if the ads are too annoying, I may opt-out. Update: Apparently only the rotating lock screen ads can be removed by opting out. The targeted ""suggestions"" that show up when you're in the Amazon Store won't go away, so I don't know if it's worth $15 to opt-out. You'll have to decide that. You can do this at any time from your ""Manage My Kindle"" page.Invariably, the Kindle Fire HD is going to be compared to the Nexus 7, its closest competition in size, performance, and price. The HD weighs 13.9 oz. vs. 12 oz. for the Nexus (the original Fire weighed 14.6 oz.). That weight difference is at least partially offset by longer claimed battery life: 11 hours for the HD vs. 8 hours for the Nexus. Screen resolution is 1280x800 for both tablets (the original Fire's resolution was 1024x600). Most of the new features of the HD, like the front-facing camera and the microphone, are common to both tablets, but the HDMI port on the HD is a very nice feature that the Nexus can't match. I've used a Nexus 7, and it's a wonderful tablet, but based on my initial impressions, my slight favorite is the Kindle Fire HD, mainly for its ability to stream Amazon instant videos (which the Nexus can't, at least not without some finagling).Overall, the HD appears to be a worthy successor to the original Kindle Fire.-------------------------------------------Update (September 15, 2012):* At first, the layout of the various screens is somewhat different from the original Fire, but after playing around for a while, I'm getting used to it, and learning how everything works is pretty intuitive.* I'm reading on forums that some folks are having problems running some of the apps they had on the original Kindle Fire. For example, I'm having problems with MapQuest - it starts up, but crashes within a minute or so. It's probably just some glitches that will be fixed with the first OS upgrade.* The power button and volume control switch are flush with the case. It's not a big deal, but I wish they stuck out a millimeter or so to make it easier to feel them.* The original Fire was noticeably rectangular, so I used it mostly in the portrait position. The HD is more square, and it seems more natural to use it in the landscape position.",How would you describe the build of the camera?,['adopter'],[15],[1],[0.],[False]

They are relatively inexpensive and have a beautiful warm, boomy sound that was absolutely shocking when I first put them on. They are the best sounding headphones I have that I can wear comfortably.These headphones have very similar sound quality to the HD280s but tend to make music more enjoyable. While the 280s are more analytical and balanced, the px 100s are more colorful and have more bass. They also do not highlight the highs so much that poor quality audio files are impossible to listen to. These headphones have half the impedance of the 280s which means you are getting richer sound in a more portable package for half the cost- with increased battery life on portables.SE110s are slightly clearer and allow individual instrumentation to be heard better, but their sound quality does not create a balance (favoring the highs) that makes music enjoyable. They are also not comfortable. Both are good for classical music but I think the PX 100s are better because of their warm sound and deep lows, which really brings crescendos to a climactic finish where SE110s always leave the listener feeling cheated out of the final hit.These have the same depth of bass response as the Sony 71s, but are more clear and are not as muddy in the mids and highs.They are about as clear in the highs as apple ear buds (they are better than most people want to think) but also allow for clear bass and do not sound tinny and like someone pushed the right side of an equalizer to max.The Ink'd ear buds are the closest in terms of overall sound to these and cost only a third of what the the PX 100s cost, but are less comfortable, do not stay in your ear, translate the sound of the cord, and only sometimes sound right (you have to have a perfect fit, which is nigh impossible)These are my favorite pair and I only put them away when I *must* be isolated from my environment. They have an amazingly rich, warm sound which adequately plays any music I can throw at it. The clarity in the upper range with older music can lend to the bass overpowering some music. It isn't as noticeable as it is when my Klipsch 2.1 system plays the same song.These are a no-brainer and I liked them more than the KSC75s, portapros, and bose triports I tried.",How is the sound?,['sound amazing' 'go from amazing to exquisiteOn their own'],[585 454],[1 1],[0.65 0.65],[ True  True]

I have watched a few Amazon instant videos and YouTube clips and they look great. The speakers are small but don't sound too bad, but this is no Bose system either. The K1 comes with a ton of apps and some are the full/pay versions such as Documents to Go. I have deleted some of the preloaded apps and have used the included Android market and Lenovo market to download other apps as well as the Amazon app market. The K1 also has GPS built in and has the Google navigation app that is pretty cool, but I will probably still use my Garmin due to it being smaller for use in my car. The K1 doesn't weigh too much and is not too bulky either. The performance is pretty fast and I have had no lags of opening or closing apps.Before I bought the Lenovo K1 I did a lot of research and saw many mixed reviews. After unboxing my K1, I updated the software to the latest version and then performed a factory reset. My K1 works perfectly and I do not have the crashing, forced closure of apps, of system freezes that many have complained about and wonder if they updated to the 829 software build(latest version as of now)and performed a factory reset if that might fix their problems.My suggestion is to go to a brick and mortar store such as Office Depot and try the Lenovo K1 out for yourself. If you like it, buy it from Amazon and save yourself some money aswell as the tax and you also get free shipping. With the money saved, you can buy a nice case to put your k1 in.*** July 2012 Update.***While my K1 has been pretty much trouble free, I can no longer recommend the K1 or any other Lenovo product. Lenovo's support of its product is pretty poor. Lenovo has an accessory called a USB host cable that makes it possible to hook up USB objects to the K1. The USB host cable was included with the K1 in Europe and other overseas locations but not in the US, when enough people complained, Lenovo received a small amount and took over a month to distribute what they had. Most owners missed out as you had only about 48 hours to order this cable and the only notification that lenovo was going to sell this cable was on a forum on thier website. Lenov also promised owners of the K1 an update to the newest version of the android software 4.0, so far Lenovo has not deliverd and the release date keeps slipping and may never arrive.Due to these problems, I NO LONGER RECOMMEND LENOVO products.",Is documentation clear?,[],[],[],[],[]

I lay back and listened for over an hour, flipping through a variety of music, amazed at the sound and ability to become completely lost in the moment.What I'm getting at is that we have gone through an assortment of headphones over the years, headphones for Walkmans (if you don't know what they are they were the best thing before iPods... sort of) headphones for cheap plastic portable cassette players, portable CD players, and finally an assortment of bud earphones for all types of mp3 players and other portable devices. Many of these are poorly built, easily broken and a sorry excuse for listening to music.I forgot how good it can sound to have the music surround your ear in a full headphone and not ear buds. The music fills a bigger space in your head than most ear buds. But don't get me wrong, I have some ear buds that are wonderful including V-MODA R-ROUGE Remix In-Ear Headphones (Rouge) which I really, really like. There is a place for bud style headphones, like walking or hanging outside somewhere. It would be difficult to wear these headphones while taking a hike or riding a bike - even though they are lightweight and comfortable...Sound: I truly got lost listening with these headphones. The sound was so clear, very layered and I could imagine in my minds eye where every musician was standing and where every instrument was placed &#34;on stage&#34;. The bass was deep, the vocals crisp and it carried through from one genre to another. They block out most noise. I had them on next to a TV at regular volume and couldn't hear the TV at all while music was playing.Comfort: They were comfortable, very soft foam surround, maybe a little too much tension to keep them tight but I'm not sure there is a way around that with this style of headphones. I was lying down while listening but they stay firm when sitting up as well. The headband is soft and fabric covered so it doesn't catch in your hair.Appearance: They are sleek looking - a little bulky but sleek for this style of headphones. They come in a cool embellished box with a form fitting case.Extras: This set came with a case, two very sturdy audio cables, one has controls for iPod 3GS and up. It also works with my iPod Classic to control volume and pause. The connections for the cables are sturdy and well designed. There are two removable 'pockets' for storing the audio cables and a Carabiner just in case you wanted to clip your headphones somewhere for storage. There is also a 1/4&#34; adapter.Please visit my customer images to see some of the detailing and extras.The packaging says that these were designed to work with iPod but I'm sure they would work well for all components.I hope to find the time, away from two young children, to use these more and more. It was a real treat to be lost in my music again. A great gift idea for the music enthusiast.",How is the presence of mid?,[],[],[],[],[]

First, I'll say that this was my last ditch effort at a wireless mouse for my laptop. I've used other Logitech mice, as well as Toshiba and Microsoft, and they have all died on me within a few months- I guess I have bad luck. Anyway, this one is still going strong, and I don't think I've ever had to change the batteries since purchasing.It has a button on top below the scroll wheel that will let you make the scroll wheel either tactile so that it ""clicks,"" or free so that you can scroll super fast. Awesome feature. You can also program the thumb button- a nice feature. The mouse is a touch on the large side for me, but it feels nice in the hand. Sometimes the top button that controls the scroll wheel can get in the way, but it's really not a big deal to me- in fact, I usually just use it as a rest for my scrolling finger.As stated in other reviews, if you think the mouse is too heavy, you can actually remove a battery and it will still work.Overall, it's a great mouse that has held up longer than any of the others I've owned. Worth the money!EDIT (3-3-13): I've owned this mouse for about two years now, no issues. The scroll wheel still glides (or clicks, whichever you prefer) without issue, and no problems with any of the buttons. As mentioned in the original review, any other mouse I've owned was toast by this point. As far as I can recall, I still have not had to change the batteries in this thing, and I pretty much never turn the power on it off - like, ever. Every once in a while when traveling (which is almost never), I'll have the forethought to turn the power off before putting it in my bag, but 90% of the time it stays in the ""on"" position while sitting on my desk.

Since I upgraded the firmware to 220, I have already rebooted the router about 4~5x, the internet connection suddenly stops. I don't know if it's just me, but I feel that the router is a bit warmer when I touch it using firmware 220. I don't have any temperature measuring device so I can't confirm that it's really warmer (I did not adjust the transmit power setting, fyi).Update (9/12/12):I updated the firmware to version 3.0.0.4.220, and the 2 previous problems I stated is still existing.. I don't mind it that much but I still hope Asus fixes it soon. Workaround for 1.) I connect my PC to 2.4Ghz. 2.) I use Splashtop from my iPhone to connect to my home PC from office.AiCloud looks promising, supposedly you could view/play your media files from your iphone/ipad and android devices within and outside your network. But I'm stuck with the loading page, after I put my login user and password. My iphone can't login. Can anyone confirm if the aicloud works?Update (8/30/12):So far have encountered 2 problems with the latest firmware (3.0.0.4.164)1. I'm using Nero Media Home 4 in my PC to share my media to my wireless TV, Bluray and PS3. When my PC is connected to 5Ghz, the tv, bluray and ps3 cannot connect to Nero. When I connect to 2.4Ghz, they can see Nero and play the media. This works fine with N66U.2. I have setup port forwarding for Remote Desktop Connection, so I can connect to my home PC from my office. It's not working. This again, is working fine with N66U.QOS is also a known problem, but I'm not using it for now. I believe it's just a firmware issue since both are working with N66U. I hope it gets fixed with the next firmware release.Original Review:I bought this to share my media files, from an external hard drive, to my 3d tv and wireless bluray in bedroom. So far I'm not disappointed. I also have N66U to compare with, I've read from other reviewers that this router gets hot, when I touch the top part, it is warm but not hot, which is the same with my N66U.This is suppose to have a greater coverage compare to N66, but to my experience, the coverage is the same, which is already awesome.Initial setup was very straightforward, easy, fast and CD-less. Below are the actual steps after opening the box:1. Connect LAN cable from modem, LAN cable going to PC, and power cable2. Open web browser. Router setup page automatically shows up. Click Next3. Type the User login and Password that you want. Click Next4. Type the SSID and key for 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz (or you can click the checkbox: Copy 2.4Ghz settings to 5Ghz settings). Click Apply.After that, your wireless device should now be able to connect to your new router. I even used the same SSID and password from my previous router, and my devices connected automatically after the setup.These are my devices that connects to this router:- 3 laptops- 2 Iphones- Ipad- wireless tv- wireless bluray- PS3- wireless printerNo problem with connections, no disconnects, iphones when outside the apartment are still connected.PROS- Media Bridge mode. Applicable using 2 AC66U. This feature is not available to N66U- Dual band, 450Mbps+1300Mbps. I can't comment with the AC speeds, I don't have wireless AC clients for now.- HTTPS authentication when accessing admin page. If your using this for office/business use, this is plus.- AiCloud. Coming soon, the app is not yet available from the appstore/googleplay as of this review. (This is now available as of firmware version 3.0.0.4.220)- 2 USB ports. Supports external hard drives, printers or 3g/4g modems- 3TB external harddrive works (Manual says only up to 2TB is supported). Tested using Seagate expansion 3TB STBV3000100. My TVs won't even accept 3TB harddrives when connected directly to its usb ports.- DHCP Manual IP assignment (if you need static private IP on your device)- DLNA. Streams HD vids, pics and 3D vids to my LG tv and my LG bluray player, no lags, no disconnects. And this is even using wireless connection and not wired.- Awesome range. Before, I was using a cheap netgear, single band 2.4Ghz, included from my ISP. From the farthest point in my apartment, I get 2 bars of signal in windows 7 wireless network connection settings. With AC66U, I get full 5 bars using 2.4Ghz, and 4 bars on the 5Ghz band.- 3 Large external antennas- Download Master (if your into P2P downloading/uploading)- Option to vertically stand the router, or wall mount- User friendly setup- Impressive performance particularly on 5Ghz band- Stylish looks and superb quality- Ability to install 3rd party firmwaresCONS- Steep price (but worth it!)- Lack of USB 3.0 (not a big deal, since I don't get usb 2.0 speeds for file transfer using FTP or Samba, which I already know before purchasing this)- Manual is a bit helpful, but this router has tons of features and the manual only mentions the basic functionalities.If you got the money, and want a great performing router and stylish as well, I Highly Recommend Asus RT-AC66U. If you're about to buy N66U, just add $20~30 to your budget, and get this router, you won't regret.",Why this feature affect the move?,['downgraded the firmware back to 164'],[19],[1],[0.],[False]

The entire Keyboard can be separated from the iPad half of the case which is perfect for users that desire a little more distance between the two.

Much better than those keyboards with the soft rubbery feel. The keyboard is also larger then most iPad keyboard which makes using it much, much easier for people like me with large hands. I charged the case once and 8 days later and its still working off the initial charge. I have no doubt that it will stay charged for weeks or months. Another great feature is the Airbender functions as a stand and can be configured in portrait mode for typing documents or landscape mode for games and movies. The case also shuts off the iPad when closed with the magnetic switch. The case looks great open or closed. I brought it to work and had several people asking me about it and where I got it.

I don't think it's heavier than it needs to be for a solid, positive movement and I can use it for hours, even corded without strain.- The 13 buttons can be programmed for 5 different profiles - Using Setpoint 5.44.5 works like a charm. The tactile feel of them is fine for my needs. I would prefer less of clicking noises using left / right and center mouse buttons.- Finishing is great matte black - less cheesy than the G500 or other ""gaming mice"". Probably a Con for ppl that like showing off, but...- User replaceable AA rechargeable Eneloop battery.- You can charge it while you use it. The ""wired"" mode transition is seamless - at least with the drivers I've used -  but some reviewers disagree on that. Setpoint 5.44.5 on Win 7 64bit never produced a freeze or loss of settings while hot-plugging the USB cable while the mouse was used.- Matte finish easy to grip. Feels ""different"" than the normal rubber padded mice, but will probably last longer too. Grip is quite positive, no concerns.- Includes USB extension cable for wireless receiver - more of a desktop user easement. Range is great for laptop use, works out to 3 feet / 1 meter easily, never had need for more.CONS:- Big, not ideal for slipping it in your laptop's slim carrying messenger bag, but nothing terrible. &lt;- actually I do carry it around in my slim messenger belkin, but that's me...- Noisy clicks...I would prefer it more subtle for ""stealth"" gaming. Hard for someone to miss what you are doing with loud blazing clicks when in the heat of battle!- Charge only via powered USB port (well, I wouldn't like to drag a docking station around, so, no biggie)- Slightly elevated slope might be uncomfortable to some - definitely not a ""claw""-grip. Works Ok with my middle-sized hands.- Does not include a unifying nano-receiver (guess the ""G series"" nano provides faster response? nothing i can feel tho)- Battery life is nothing to talk home about, but not terrible, and you can replace it almost on the fly (or hook the USB cable). On par or better with most high performance mice, that are tied to Li-Ion proprietary battery packs.This review follows almost 3 weeks after the mouse has been purchased.Main thoughts -- Productivity PerformanceUsed the G700 in a variety of applications, mainly design programs and games. The 5 available profiles work a charm and you can program the driver to ""sense"" the application's .exe and switch profiles on the fly: switching between say - Autodesk Revit and SketchUp to Adobe Illustrator and back for copy-pasting etc, the software follows you switching profiles seamlessly, altering assigned macros for the thumb / side buttons. Each profile can have it's own DPI setting and DPI steps that you can then hard-set on the fly on the mouse. The profiles are stored on the mouse's internal mem-bank too, so you take those settings with you to use on multiple PCs.- Gaming PerformanceThe real performance difference is in games tho, where you really feel the increase in precision despite the dpi used - I doubt that people can positively utilize more than 2000dpi on their mice, with me finding a limit close to the 1600dpi. Above that you cannot be precise enough for anything but laid back internet browsing.I do play MMOs (EVE online), where the extra buttons can do macros etc just fine but precision is not that critical. In the more demanding FPS world, the mouse clearly shines. To be honest I've never had complains on the responsiveness of the VX Nano or the Microsoft's Mobile 4000, yet the G700 beats them on all surfaces. Almost any cheap cloth mouse-pad (used it on black and grey) did improve the feel of it over bare desktop surfaces.Tracking while you snipe is great, and sensitivity is easily adjusted by the default keys left of your right index finger. You can customize the dpi switching to be assigned to any key, with +/- steps in independent keys or looping through the settings with just one key.The ""extra"" G keys have a positive feel and I personally found them quite easy to find and identify just with touch. Unlike other reviewers, I did like the thumb keys and I can use them each and every time without missing or guessing. All of them work for both a slight ""upward/in"" movement of the thumb, or direct depression. Did not run into locking problems when using more than 2-3 buttons at a time (speaking on coms, using assigned macros and/or firing etc).Response is great and you cannot tell between wired and wireless.- Side status LEDs3 triangle LEDs live on the left side of the G700. With 3x primary colors, indicate the profile in use in case you manually switch(orange - 5 steps), DPI used (Red, 5 steps) and battery life (Green, 3 steps, with a single Red coming on when battery is really low).- More on the sensor's DPI ratingRemember tho that most ""common"" optical mice dance around the 800-1000 dpi range, and with today's screen real-estate (typical 1920x1080) and dual screen configs being  common, many times you need to move a 800dpi mouse along your mouse-pad and even lift/return it for some more to go from one edge to the other. The software allows you to set 5 dpi steps for each profile, and I have none going above 3200 dpi (nor did the factory settings).- BatteryThe mouse comes with a single Sanyo Eneloop battery, and typically lasts about 2 days of work/gaming. Keep in mind that I do use my computer at least 10 hours a day, so I am happy with that. Charging usually completes within 3-4 hours while in use. Never timed it tho. The ""low battery"" indicator does come up on your screen, but as other reviewers mentioned, it's too conservative and you do have at least a couple of hours - or more - of usage after the warning.Personally I would prefer 2x AA batteries in parallel (like with the M705 marathon) for better battery life. Also keep in mind that despite the fact that the Eneloop is one of the highest quality NiMH batteries out there, their rated capacity is 1900-2000mAh, while most high capacity AA NiMH are rated around 2500-2700mAh. I tend to believe that the Eneloops would shine on low-drain, long battery life applications, something the G700 is clearly not. I don't have a spare 2700mAh (I use them in my flash units), but I believe the G700 would be better paired with such cells.- Corded use and chargingAgain, the transition from wireless to wired mod was seamless in my experience and the latest drivers.The cord is not the softest around, but I never felt it ""stiff"" and uncomfortable as some reported. It's an ok cord. Not as soft as many silicon-skinned cords some mice used, but works fine for me.The USB wire connector utilizes a micro-USB male plug on the G700's end. That means that any such cable could work for both using and charging the mouse. For the latter, probably any 5V mobile phone charger would work  too, for those who desperately need an off-USB charging device (many PCs do power their USBs when in sleep mode, so charging is happening even when the machine is not ""on""). Micro USB is supposed to be the EU standard for cell phone charging since 2010 (Apple, Nokia, Samsung, LG, Motorola etc among others agreed on using it universally) so more and more devices will provide compatible chargers.- Why the G700? So many Mice out there!As I was mostly on the move, I do appreciate wireless mice, and I've been spoiled by the nano-receiver on my Logitech VX Nano for more than 2 years now. The thing is simply amazingly versatile and quite fool-proof (not in a few occasions people had damaged the  dongle, destroyed a USB port or both due to them protruding in the wrong place at a wrong time.Since I've bought the VX nano, I've used a couple of mice on friends computers and/or tried some on mine. I did not fail to notice that the old generation Laser ""848nm"" sensor they VX Nano and most of the nano-receiver mice Logitech produced the last few years (V220, M505, M705) did lack in tracking precision, even against relatively cheaper competitors like the Microsoft Mobile 4000 mouse - a unit that if it wasn't for the extremely jerky/cheap feel of its wheel/center button would be almost perfect for the &lt;$20 price many vendors sell it for.Since I liked the Hyper-Fast scroll wheel in my VX nano, but I've hated the fact that the center mouse button was not on the wheel, the main contenders for replacing it where all full scaleLogitech mice, which provided all of:* Hyper-scroll wheel + center mouse button with positive feel* Better tracking than the VX nano* Ideally wireless with nano-receiver.* At least 2-3 programmable buttons, but not as badly placed as on the VX Nano.* Not really expensive - I ended up buying on the high end of my budget but most competitive ""gaming"" mice offered less features for the same price.The G700 was chosen over:- The G500 - seemed a great mouse, but cheesy in appearance and not really cheaper in the long run especially since it's only wired.- The Performance MX. Relatively better battery life, but not that better (still a high precision sensor with only one AA battery), not cheaper, less buttons (that many will not use anyways), with a unified nano receiver. I believe it would be a great alternative if it was actually cheaper. Has the ""glass capable"" dark field technology, but I never planned on using it on glass.- G400/300 - only wired, cheap(er) feel, great tracking. Don't like the right side buttons on the G300.Anywhere Mouse MX: All the pros of the VX nano, and all the cons too, but the 2 side buttons placement. Nothing a VX nano owner will actually want, unless you have to use it on glass and/or really need a unified receiver to use with a keyboard or something.- M705 ""Marathon"" mouse: Did not promise better tracking, but would give great autonomy and a definitely better battery life. Unifying receiver, way better scroll wheel than the nano-mice - if you care for middle clicking...off center sensor etc where never annoyances for my game style.6 month Update:After 6 months with the G700, I have nothing more to say that it still feels a great buy. I use it daily for design/drafting and gaming. Battery life is mediocre, but will easily last 20 or so hours of use in my hands. The matte finishing still looks great, with only a hint of skin grease visible on the left button. G keys never missed a beat thus far. Wish it had a unifying receiver to be perfect (ended up getting a K series unified keyboard for my laptop and I get to use 2x USB ports just for input devices).9 month Update:Rock and solid in every department other than battery life. Tried an old GP 2700mAh and still the mouse needs to be plugged every other day the most - and I am not using it @ 1000 reports /sec for productivity tasks which is 90%+ of the hours it is used. Got used to it, but Logitech should definitely consider a 2x AA design for the next flagship mouse, even if they come up with reduced consumption components.",How long is the battery life?,['for hours' '20 or so hours'],[  259 10295],[1 1],[0. 0.],[False False]

The keyboard continues to be easy to use even in big hands. One complaint I had with my old keyboard was a lack of cut, copy paste functions. Well now I have them and they work well for my purposes. Also included are function keys for brightness, volume, music/video play options, and home screen or locking the screen. They all work well and make navigating easier.The case itself has a nice look and feel to it. The case doesn't feel cheap or too plasticky. As the name suggests its a clamshell design, that remains as one unit, with a swivel arm that allows for you to display the iPad in either landscape or portrait positions. The arm has a nice strong feel to it, since it is made of metal rather than plastic. The arm could use a lock that keeps the iPad at the user's perfect pitch, but the pitch at the fully extended position feels fine to me.Easy bluetooth connection, and great battery life make this a great keyboard. I have had for about 10 days now and have yet to plug in for my first charge. One feature I am happy to see is the bottom of the case doesn't prohibit you from being able to utilize the lightning adapter for old 30 pin products. I happen to have one of these and use it for charging while traveling.Overall I like this keyboard, but I have had the opportunity to also use New Trent Airbender 2.0 for the iPad air as well. While I do like the look and feel of this version, I am much happier using the Airbender 2.0 due to the ability to detach the back of the case from the keyboard itself. If you are someone who mostly uses their iPad with a bluetooth keyboard often, this may be the way to go, otherwise if you are like me and want a functional keyboard at times, with the ability to leave it at home and still have a case for your iPad, think about the Airbender 2.0.",How about profile?,[],[],[],[],[]

The daylight picture quality is adequate and the nighttime infared (doesn't work through windows) is surprisingly good IMHO for such a relatively cheap camera that has two way audio.  The 270 degree rotation plus the up and down range provides an ample range of view.  I was able to figure out how to setup remote viewing by using the port forwarding instructions provided on the website.  The wait for tech support was surprisingly short.  I actually was able to speak to a live person from some offshore help desk.  My questions were pretty basic but I was able to get everything setup and running with a matter of a couple of hours.  I had to hop in my car and drive to an internet caf&eacute; to confirm the remote viewing.  I couldn't confirm remote access in my house.  Doh!  I followed the security advice and purchased a DDNS provider for $19.95 per year to get a unique web address (no need to make things easy for hackers that flock to the free Foscam DDNS site).  The basic utility that allows you to setup users with ADMIN, OPERATOR, or VISITOR levels of access along with their passwords is pretty straight forward.  All this for about $70 plus the $19.95/yr for a unique DDNS.  In short, I am pleasantly surprised how easy it is to do this for such little money.Additional note on the Freezing Issue:  The Contrast is set to 4 and it works fine (backyard/garden/trees view).  I experienced the freezing and reboot when I set the contrast to 6.  It gave some warning signs when part of the picture started to freeze.  I set the contrast back down to 4 when it rebooted itself.  Given that I saw no discernible difference between a contrast of 4 and 6 (looking through a window to the outside) I am not concerned.  The indoor picture quality is acceptable.  Given the slow internet in my area and my desire to add additional cameras, I am happy with the 640 x 480 quality.

On paper, it was a good router for the money, it did all the things I needed of it (and then some), but in the end it didn't work out.Our setup includes the following: 1 TV hard-wired to a router for streaming Amazon Prime, etc., 2 laptops on wifi, 2 Roku boxes, 2 iPhones on wifi, 1 iPad, 1 iPod touch, and 1 PS3.The router worked almost all of the time, but that's not good enough for a router.When I first got it, it worked but would reset itself several times a day.  I finally figured out that that was due to the ""self-healing"" or whatever it's called.  When I turned that setting off in the settings, it stopped resetting itelf.  But even outside of that, I had this hooked up for a total of 3 weeks and several times it would lose connection and once I had to go uplug and replug router and modem.  The last few days before I returned it, I would be on PS3 and get random connection errors.In the good column, we have a 20.0 Mb/s connection from our ISP and it would always carry the signal at that speed through the whole of our house, which is about 3,000 sq. ft including 2 floors plus a basement.  While I never really tested trying to overload it by using Amazon Prime, PS3 and some other connections at the same time, it never seemed to lag when several family members were using the internet. Also, the router itelf looks better than most, meaning it could be out in the open in a room and not look too bad.  I liked that it has 4 ethernet outs.Also, the settings are a bit overwhelming and the software seems slow and buggy.  And any time you made any change to the settings, the router would reset itself for between 15-90 seconds.  That seemed like a big of overkill.Lastly, the guest network feature would work, but the connection under that separate SSID name was hideously slow.  If the regular one was connecting at or close to the 20.0 mb/s that we get for speed, the guest network would connect at something like 0.25 mp/s.  That's unacceptable.In the end, I didn't want a router that I had to ""babysit"", and I always felt like that's what I was doing with this.  So I got the Apple Airport Exteme.  So far so good with that.",Is this thing hard to handle?,[],[],[],[],[]

I am not going to regurgitate it all back to you again, instead I will go over what stood out and what I had problems with when using this router in my network.As far as what good things stood out the router has 3 external antennas that are detachable allowing you to upgrade the antennas if you want. I like having antenna options. There are dedicated wireless and power on / off switches on the rear of router allowing easy rebooting and absolute control over the wireless signal. I was able to achieve my rated download and upload speeds from my ISP. I did not have to reboot the router because it locked up. The router runs really cool to the touch. There are wall mount slots on the bottom of the router. overall things generally work like they should.As far as what bad things stood out to me the router has a shiny black finish making it a fingerprint and dust magnet. There are no rubber feet on the bottom and it has a tendency to slide around on my desk. I dislike the bright blue LEDs that are angled up on the front panel.  I only need to see what is up at a quick glance directly at the router. I don't need the router to be constantly attracting my attention even when I am not directly looking at it. I don't like the fact that I can't see all LAN and Wireless clients along with their MAC and IP Addresses listed on a page. The wireless signal strength is not as strong as that from my Netgear WNDR3700v1.  Placing my cell phone back in my bedroom in the same exact spot swapping the routers in the same spot on my desk and measuring the signal using Wi-Fi Analyzer I measured the following:TP-Link 2.4GHz -76 dBm and 5GHz -88dBm vs Netgear 2.4GHz -65 dBm and 5GHz -84dBm.So my older Netgear with internal antennas seemed to have a better signal between those spots. I also had this weird problem where I had a Seagate Wireless Plus drive connected to the router via wireless. When I would do file transfers from a wired PC on the network to the Seagate drive the other devices on the network (wired or wireless) would slow to a crawl. I haven't gotten to the bottom of what that problem was yet so it could be the drive or the router at this point. I will have to do further testing in the future.I did not have a problem setting up the router. I have been through a lot of routers in my time. If you are new to configuring a router you may need some help figuring out what does what. Each page has a help section to the right of it. It is nice that it is there but you sometimes get that problem with a not so smooth translation to English so you aren't quite sure what they mean. You can figure most things out but some things are tough because of the translation and limited info.Overall not the most impressive router in my eyes but it is OK. I have had to test routers before that just wouldn't function for any period of time, at least this one can perform its core functions while maybe not near the top of what I would hope for, at least it does it reliably. Remember too that routers are a moving target with firmware updates, some things might get better and some things might get worse in the future. If you can get one for the right price it might be worth a look to you if you are in the market for a router.Update: I removed a complaint about no guest wireless. As support pointed out to me in the comments a new firmware came out after I started using the router to review it. The new firmware has guest networks for wireless along with several other fixes and improvements. So as I said a moving target and things can get better.

This is a full frame camera that provides great resolution for awesome cropping or wide angle shots. Although the current AF system is old, it is still very good. You will need to make sure your glass and body are at their optimum calibration as it is possible that even new out of the box to be slightly off. The factory will calibrate any Canon products within the first year for free. I suggest that you take them up on the deal. The only cost is your shipping to them. They are fast and good at what they do. Be aware that every lens can be off in either direction from zero being a front or back focussing issue. The body itself can be off, so do make sure the setup is right before doing any comparisons. All EOS models now offer micro adjustments to limit the need for sending out for calibration if you don't have the ability to part with your equipment for a few days.The 5D Mark II takes stunning crisp photos. I've tested with 24-70 2.8L USM, 70-200 2.8L USM, 50mm 1.4, 85mm 1.8 with very good results. The HD video is a bonus. The lack of autofocus is not the worst trade off. The option to take clips of video when needed is nice though.If you are on the fence about brand to choose and have not invested to much in one brand or another, do look into both Nikon, and Canon for the best options for you. The extra focus points are really nifty on the d700, but the lack of resolution and HD video option on the canon side is a big plus. Those moving up from existing Canon Digitals will appreciate the faster and more accurate focus that comes with all 9 points being in focus with hidden focus point assisting the crisp focus to the corners. I'm very pleased with this model and the options for indoor and outdoor shooting. ISO is so good that 3200 is better than 1600 on my 50D.  The only issues I've had are with the slower continuous shooting FPS, and the flimsy shutter sound that does not inspire confidence in comparison to my 50D's fast and bold thuds. Ironically, the 5D2's capable of locking on to the targets in low light even with a delayed shutter will capture action more reliably than the 50D. I shoot a lot of indoor night shots in poorly lit gyms that the 5D2 outshines the 50D on the keeper rate with the identical lenses. The 50D has become my outdoor maximum reach tool. Even then the crops from the 5D2's are better. Its just the case where I carry the contrasting distance lenses to avoid missing shots altogether.A great camera that is up there with the really high end SLR's with a much lower entry level. Glass is still expensive but you can keep that for ever if you take care of it.Edit:After several years of pure magic from this camera and replacing the 50D with a 7D. The 7D is the next best thing to the 5D2 when the 5D3 is not an economical addition to your gear. The 5D2 has an incredible ISO range with such great image clarity, even with action shots in less than perfect lighting. Shooting side by side with the 7D has me wishing I just had 2 5D2's. This camera is the most affordable professional Full Frame camera on the market. It is still that great after all these years. Lenses go up in price, while bodies come down in price.

I would charge it at the end of every day, so not sure how much longer it would last if I kept using it.Cons:- Although it is very comfortable and easy to wear during active runs and gym sessions, it just feels flimsy to me.The little earbuds are supposed to be held onto the neckband with little magnets.  These magnets are far too weak and barely hold them in when they are stationary.  They are also not the easiest to fit in place while the neckband is still around your neck.If you do manage to fit them in, the slightest head movement causes them to fall out.This is not only frustrating, but with them just dangling there, they easily got caught on my jacket, shoulder strap of my purse and scarf.It was an accident waiting to happen and I just knew they'd get torn off one day soon.Another concern was how they'd hold up being toted around in bag.  If you don't want to walk around with them hanging around your neck, there's really no easy way to transport them.  I'd wear them on the train to listen to music, but didn't want to leave them on once I got to work.  I'd put them in my bag, but then had to wrestle with a tangle when I retrieved them.Overall very disappointed because although user unfriendly, the sound and comfort of these were great.

I'm sure there's a way to turn the latter off and I haven't had much trouble with the keypad since that first day. Maybe it just needed to map my finger size, I don't know.Second, the wifi can be a little bit of a pain when connecting to certain networks. When I'm at home on my own wireless, there's no issue, but when I'm at work, it's constantly dropping off the network and I have to redo the login procedure. Now, that's probably my work ISP's fault, but it would be nice if there were a way for the kindle to save that info so I didn't have to reenter it each time.Third, is an overall kindle catalog complaint... there just aren't any manga titles that I want to purchase for the Fire. It seems like the entire available catalog of manga for kindle is Yaoi. Nothing against the genre, but I want titles like Yotsuba and Emma and Dance in the Vampire Bund on my kindle, not just boy-love titles that have no appeal to me.Still, overall, I am VERY happy with my Kindle Fire...

I've had it for six months and the sound still sounds the same meaning the quality did not degrade, but there is a minor problem. Every time I do turn on the speaker, it makes a loud static noise which is annoying. Not sure if it's a product defect or if all speakers go through this phase. I've had this problem since the 4th month and was seeing if it persisted for a while and it seems like it's likely to be permanent. I have also never played shifted the &#34;Volume&#34; knob more than halfway. But other than that, the static noise is there reason why I took off a star, but other than that, the speakers itself pleased my ears and is still doing so.

It does have amazing features and an amazing grip but it still has flaws that render it useless for some.Reliability:2 years, dropped so many times and still works like the first day I got it. I think it's reliable enough and the finish is great, not a single scratch.Installation:Is straightforward. You can use the Windows built-in drivers (plug and play) and it will work straightaway. However, if you want to use the many features of the mouse you'll have to install Logitech SetPoint.Software:SetPoint is OK. It has it's bugs (in Vista x64 it would sometimes forget your settings on startup and you would need to double click the SetPoint taskbar icon for it to activate - an example is the wheel setting, being click-to-click or middle button). Older versions (I'm at 4.80) had problems in recognizing the mouse in Vista x64, this seems to have been solved from 4.xx.Features:Nevertheless it gives good flexibility in configuring the mouse. Which, in turn, comes with many features of which:- Configurable wheel (free to spin - or normal click-click-click), if you don't want a middle-button you can set it to shift between the two. Or you can even let SetPoint automatically decide based on your scrolling speed.- The wheel itself would act as left/right buttons if you push it to the sides. I never used this feature and as I don't find it easy. It's not very comfortable really.- 2 additional buttons on the side, and one in the middle just behind the wheel - configurable to whatever you like.- A 2nd wheel...ish thing.. It's useful to scroll through open windows.The mouse feels great in the hand and is quite comfortable but it may need to be elevated slightly higher than the normal position comfortable for the keyboard. This of course also depends on how big your hands are, mine are big.Tracking:Is great. Works fine on almost all surfaces I tried it on. You will hardly find a surface that this mouse doesn't track on.Speed:Not the best feature. 800 dpi and response (or refresh) rate is way low. I'm not sure if this is wireless lagging or because of the sensor itself but the mouse is SLOW so forget using it for fast action gaming. Seriously, forget it and go look somewhere else if you want this mouse for gaming. THAT, and add to it how HEAVY the mouse is, it WILL set you back in games.Wireless:Bad. It interferes with 2.4GHz wifi. I changed routers, changed channels, changed all kinds of settings in my wifi network and it still interferes like crazy. Of course this only happens when there is heavy load on the wireless network - like downloads or something. But you would expect better from Logitech. This is not acceptable.Because of speed and the wireless problems I finally gave up on it and purchased a wired habu (microsoft-razer). Yes, it's old but I got it for a good price and honestly I didn't know what I was missing. I didn't want to take another chance with Wireless for now (although another cheapo mouse I have has no issues with wifi whatsoever) and I wanted something lighter and faster (which wireless mice normally lack). And I'm very happy with it. Hence, I decided to finally come and write this review.",How was the feature?,[],[],[],[],[]

Kept looking at the Microsoft Surface RT (didn't want to pay the price of the pro) and also looking here at ASUS and Lenovo.  When I saw the Venue come out I wanted to touch one so went to the Microsoft Store a few blocks from my office.  I spent about an hour going back and forth between the Suface 2 and the Venue.  The main reason was size and comparison between RT and Full Windows 8.1.  I wanted something that splits between a PC, Tablet, and eReader (huge Kindle fan).  After thinking about what my life would be like sitting on an Airplane and what would be more comfortable to work with I picked the Venue 8 Pro.  I have had this for about 4 days now (bought at Microsoft Store, price was the same as prime and I was in an instant satisfaction mode).What I like:1.  Size, this is large enough that the office tools, apps, and web browsing are functional2.  It keeps my Kindle on my night stand when I travel.  I was using my Windows Phone and it worked find but it was a bit small and this is much better and holds like my Kindle3.  It is full blown Windows, not RT so I can load my other apps on it4.  The disk space is good,  with 64G it leaves over 30G to use,  I added a 32G MicroSD card to it and can't think of how I will run out of space.5.  Full Windows from the start screen is familiar, don't need to learn anything new.  Not a huge fan of Windows 8 but on a tablet it works great.What I don't like:Configuring Windows 8.1 on a small device is a bit tedious, so need to be patient on the setups and get a stylus (I had one).The few comments on the start button being on the side really isn't an issue, a left swipe from the right side of the screen gets you to start very quickly.  So far battery is great, I did remove the dimming and put my own setting on.  I got alittle over 9 hours on the battery that way and other than international flights don't know when I wouldn't be in a position to charge it throughout the day.The screen is good, I added a bluetooth keyboard / case to this and still getting used to the keyboard.  The split keyboard on screen actually works well in the hand and I may toss the bluetooth keyboard.  I don't plan on writing documents on this and mostly for email, reading, and browsing.Already put Pandora on it, sounds OK with the speaker.  Have Sonos at home and have that installed as well as few other apps I like.  Really don't need thousands of apps and there are enough to make this fully functional for my use.The last point is I didn't buy an Apple because they just charge too much for the brand.  I actually had a significant amount of interest from the iPAD users who started to go look at reviews on this after they saw it.  $349 for a Full Windows 8 tablet with 64G, 8&#34; screen (Kindle form factor) is hard to ignore.Go ahead and buy it, you will like it for utility.",How do you like the screen?,['the screen gets you to' 'The screen is good'],[1731 2017],[1 1],[0. 0.],[False False]

Last year I built my first P9X79 Deluxe system using the Cooler Master HAF 932 Advanced Full Tower and was very happy with its quiet fans. With a Nuactua NH-D14 CPU cooler. This thing is almost silent. Because I need all the processing power and memory I can get within a budget, I opted to build a second similar system to add as a render Farm box. I bought a base P9X79 with the exact same 3930K, 64GB memory, power supply, CPU cooler and SSD drives. Not needing all the bells a whistles from the deluxe board I also decided to get the midsized HEF 922. Having a quiet computer is very important to me and this is the reason I chose to stick with The HAF series. Once I got the new system assembled, I was very disappointed to hear the roar of fans from the fans in the 922. The noise levels from the fans stated on the website do not match those printed on the owners manual. (23dBA vs 19dBA) The HAF 922 is far louder then the 932. What ever Cooler master changed in terms of cooling fans, it is clearly not at the same quality of the 932. The noise level is not something I can live with every day so I had to decide weather to return the box at my own expense and time to disassemble, pack, ship and reassemble, or buy some new fans. In order to get a similar low noise level enjoyed by the 932, I have to replace all three of the factory fans and add an optional 200 mm fan to the side. I understand there is a fine line between the open air design of the HEF for cooling and vs noise level but the HAF 932 design is almost the same as the 922 and vary quiet if all other components are low noise. Cooler Master claims the same quality in a mid size tower. All said and done, I should have bought another HAF 923 and save myself the time and dissatisfaction with Cooler Master. At this point, the only thing Cooler master could do for me is send me new fans or reimburse me for the price I paid for 19dBA versions.",Which case do you prefer?,[],[],[],[],[]

It's been okay so far.Any prospective buyer should be aware of the following before making the purchase:- Definitely meant for travel and laptops, less suitable on one's desk or desktop machines (see below).- The cord is VERY short. This is an issue with desktops. I suppose it's possible to plug the hub in and leave it hanging off the front or the back of a desktop computer but it's not something that I would do.- Related to the above, it is not a fashion statement. The hub is functional and allows 4 USB devices to be plugged into it but it is not likely to win any design award. I mention this because, with the chord being as short as it is, the likely space this hub will occupy is on your desk.- It is not powered. As such, do not plan to use it with (more than one) USB-powered hard drives. It should be okay if the drives use their own power supply.- It does not have many blinking lights like some other hubs do. I like that.Overall, the Ultra Mini Hub is a useful device and it should be an excellent buy to the extent that the buyer is aware of the issues I listed above.

For the price, especially if you got in when they had the Netflix deal, this was almost impossible to pass up. Now, I'm a bit of a tech guy and have a computer plugged into every TV in my house, but this is still great for sharing YouTube and Netflix videos to the big screen without having to go switch inputs and grab my keyboard. I like the CEC support to turn on and change the input of your TV automatically the most.I can only give 4 stars out of 5 though because while the product is fantastic and the price is right, it still hasn't been adopted by many other apps than the initial few. Hulu recently added support, but Google has been fairly quiet about the product since announcing it. Still, even if you just used it for YouTube, Netflix, and/or Hulu, it's so cheap it's still a great buy. I'd really like to see Google use this technology more though and it would be worth a full 5 stars.For those comparing with Apple TV or Airplay, I don't see any reason for these products to co-exist as they do very similar tasks. The difference though is that using Airplay requires you to buy an Apple TV at minimum which is a good bit more expensive. Simply put though, if you're an Apple person with a lot of Apple products, you may be happier with an Apple TV using Airplay. Otherwise, this cheaper alternative can perform similarly if not even better once Google and other companies (hopefully) start to utilize it more.",How is the time?,[],[],[],[],[]

I've read that ear buds send more decibels into the ear than headphones set at the same volume, and that even children are experiencing hearing loss from this.I am very happy with the sound quality. I've used them for listening to music, watching TV, playing video games, and I also plug them into my amp to play bass guitar (A 1/4"" adapter is included in the box). They have served me well for all of these purposes. I am just a general user, not an audiophile, and can't dissect the sounds like a connoisseur at a wine tasting, but they sound good to me.The headphones are a little tight, and I have to situate them just right if I am going to use them for longer than an hour or so.

If you're a videophile and analyze specs and features then this camera isn't for you. Using the Flip MinoHD reminded me of why I was skeptical about buying an iPhone when Apple first launched it and why I ultimately bought one and why I feel the iPhone is a fantastic device despite all of it's limitations. Now on to the Flip...There's not much in the box (camera, soft case, strap), the battery can't be changed, and the memory can't be expanded. There's no CD included (the software is on the device) and no cables are included (or needed for most users). There are almost no settings to play with: set the date, time, beeps on/off, recording light on/off and you're ready to go. The ergonomics are ok. It's tough to make a small device easy to hold and use and the display is small but that's to be expected of such a tiny package.For many products this kind of simplicity would suggest that the manufacturer tried to cut costs (e.g. Apple not including an AC Adapter with iPods). In the case of the Flip the message I heard was clearly different: you don't need any of these things.

It perform wells in all lighting conditions including low light.

I waited to review it, because glitches and problems generally show up after the excitement has worn off.  I've had a couple of thoughts of ""I wish,"" but nothing that would make me lower my rating.  Here's what I like--and what I don't:This screen is absolutely beautiful.  I wanted it mostly for books, but videos and content are flawless on it.  The books are beautiful and crisp, too, with plenty of options to change brightness and color.  This cuts down on eye strain.  There is a glare, in bright sun.  This is worse than a regular kindle, but not as bad as most tablets.  I was expecting much worse, with the HD screen, so I've just put it down as the best possible at this time.I wanted this because I'm in college and constantly needing books.  It's faster, easier, and cheaper to download kindle books than to try to buy them in a physical copy, especially when I need  some of the more obscure titles for my classes.  I still have books that I want for myself in hardback form, but nothing beats kindle for college!The build is sturdy, but light.  I don't feel like I'm going to break it if I touch it, but it's comfortable to hold.A lot of people complain about not being able to get Google play content and try to find workarounds, but I don't need that, so it's not an issue for me.  I'd rather buy from Amazon, anyway.  Past experience has taught me that their customer service and quality is superior.  If you aren't like me and you want to be able to access absolutely everything in the world on one device, it might be a drawback.  For me, it's not a problem.  I haven't come across anything I need that Amazon doesn't offer--usually cheaper and/or better then the other guys.I am not very techno-savvy, so it's a plus for me that this device is easy and ready to use right out of the box.  I signed in to Amazon and had everything I've bought in the past at my fingertips.One MINOR drawback is the memory.  You'd think 16gb was enough, but it's only enough if you keep your content in the cloud.  That's fine, if you aren't traveling, but if you find yourself without wifi access you cannot get to your content.  I downloaded a season of a tv show, knowing I would be without wifi, and it really ate up the memory, slowing my kindle fire down a lot.  After watching, I removed the episodes from the device and the slowdown disappeared.  I found myself wishing for more memory, then.  Most of the time, though, I rely on the cloud and 16gb is fine.  I just have to remember that small limitation.  (If I were buying one, I'd go with the 32gb model, personally, and have a little more room to download content for the times I'll be without access.  This was a gift, so I cannot really complain.)  I love the cloud and use it for most things, anyway, so it's a minor issue.  The only time memory is a problem is when I'm traveling.  For some, that might be a bigger issue than it is for me, as it's a portable device.  On my daughter's tablet, which has expandable memory, we are able to download a lot more content and take it with us.  Entertainment is never out of reach, even without internet.  All in all, though, my kindle is easier to work, has a better screen, and is organized better.  Everything has drawbacks.I haven't found anything in the three weeks I've had my kindle fire that would make it anything less than a great value.  I definitely recommend this device.  It has been very helpful and entertaining.",How does the device work?,['loved it immediately' 'this device is easy and ready'],[  29 1801],[2 2],[0.8 0.8],[ True  True]

That would be the quality and flexibility of the video, the quality of the optical image stabilization, and the overall quality of the still pictures it takes.  I didn't care about the GPS as it is largely a gimmick in my opinion and all the major competitors have it now or they feel they won't be able to compete.You should realize that the GPS built into this camera (and most cameras) is NOT the same GPS you may be used to in your car or smart phone.  It does not have detailed maps, does not have a large database of places or landmarks, and is not as accurate.  It is basically for tagging your photos and videos with the latitude and longitude of where you took the image so you don't have to take notes manually to sort out what you shot and where later.  That's why I consider it largely a gimmick.Briefly then, this camera had by far, the best video quality and flexibility.  You can select AVCHD video in several quality levels including full HD at 1920 x 1080 @ 60 fps (if your computer can handle it--many can't), MP4 video in several quality settings including full HD 1920 x 1080 @ 30 fps, and even a (not too useful) 320 x 240 setting for high-speed video at 240 fps.FOR TECHIES ONLY: Note that most of these video settings output progressive video but one of them outputs interlaced (can't remember which AVCHD setting).  This makes me suspicious that the internal video circuitry may be interlaced and not progressive and they simply convert (deinterlace) the video when they create the progressive video file on the memory card.  I could not find confirmation on this anywhere and calling Panasonic support is utterly useless for something this technical--they just aren't trained to know such things.  I must say though that I didn't notice any interlaced artifacts or sharpness/quality issues with the video so I'm satisfied with the video either way.The optical image stabilization is absolutely amazing and was so far superior to the Nikon for example, that I had to keep checking that I actually had the image stabilization in the Nikon turned on!  You can literally hand-hold the camera at full 20x zoom (being very deliberate and careful) and shoot acceptable video, which is almost unheard of in a small camera like this.The still images are very high quality and have relatively low noise for a camera that has this many pixels in the sensor.  Most consumers don't realize that it's mostly the marketing departments that want to keep pushing the number of pixels in these small cameras.  The engineers know that when you put this many pixels on a small sensor, you get more noise artifacts and you can do only so much about that.  This camera is no different in that regard than all the others that are 14 or higher megapixels, regardless of what they claim in their marketing hype.And the final selling point over some of the competitors for me was that this camera, even with all its consumer ""presets"" to make this a ""point-and-shoot"" camera (actually almost too many--confusing!) still has FULL MANUAL CONTROLS and aperture or shutter priority settings for ""real"" photographers.Note that like most other pocket cameras, this one does not support RAW files but that's not what it is intended for.  Furthermore, with single images files as large as almost 13 MB in size from the 14.1 megapixel sensor, you have more than enough pixels to do some serious Photoshop work even without having RAW files to work with.This will now be my ""take everywhere"" camera when I don't need to do ""serious"" photography and don't want to lug around my full sized Canon DSLR and lenses.",Is the tv in silent mode?,[],[],[],[],[]

Wireless configuration was a breeze. Was using Netflix in just a few minutes. Netflix works extremely well. Seemless kick ask video performance. It also offers Vudu. Didn't know what this was so I gave Vudu a try. Kick ask. I didn't know HD could be streamed over the internet so well. Movies look great on Vudu and so easy to use through the BD390. When I show Vudu to other people I get confused looks. ""Your Blu-ray player is going on the internet? Huh.""I was not impressed with the music playing via the USB port. There is no shuffle; not even within a single folder. And then when you get to the end of the last file in a folder, instead of continuing to play the first file on the next folder, it just stops. Not kick ask. Lame. I can fit my entire music collection on a 4 GB USB stick, so I intend to use the BD390 to listen to music with the USB and not use CDs. These limitations on USB play back are lame.I have to hand it to blu-ray player makers on how much stuff they are jamming into these small and afforable boxes. There are billions of formats (both audio and video) and media types to deal with. Really amazing. But you know, I once bought a $49 DVD player that could remember the stopped position of the last 5 DVDs played. So if you ejected the DVD and then re-inserted it, it could continue playing where you left off. I have yet to see a blu-ray player offer this feature, but near the climax of DVD player feature advancement, many DVDs offered this feature. This is a very usefull feature if disk switching occurs before finishing them. So to some degree, I'm poo-pooing all blu-ray players until I see this commonly available DVD feature on blu-ray players. Skip the non-kick ask BD Live. I can really care less about BD Live, but I'm sure thousands of hours of engineering development went into it.-- Begin Update 11/29/2009 --I just realized the BD390 can remember the stopped position of blu-rays even if you eject the disc. The manual is very unclear about this feature. Manual seems to indicate it does not work for all discs. Only tried with one disc, so don't know how many stop positions it can store. The $49 DVD player refered to above could store five.-- End Update 11/29/2009 ---- Begin Update 12/10/2009 --OK, the assessment of whether the BD390 can remember the stopped position is still unclear. I have had several disks now that don't even remember their stopped position even if you do not eject the disk. So, in other words, I'm leaving the disk in, but just stopping play and powering down the BD390. When I power the BD390 back up, the disk left in starts back up with the trailers and goes to menu. Not kick ask. I don't know why with the 11/29/2009 update above it remembered the position with that disk and other do not. When I did the test on 11/29, I did not power down the unit; just ejected and reloaded. With the last few disks, even if eject and reload without powering down, they still don't remember stopped position. So it seems the functionality is hit and miss here. I'm hoping LG sees this as a problem and offers a firmware update.-- End Update 12/10/2009 ---- Begin Update 6/2/2010 --It appears that LG has fixed the hit and miss problem of remembering the stop position of a disc. With the latest firmware update, the player remembers where a disc was left.-- End Update 6/2/2010 --The picture quality is great with the BD390. It is not clear from the marketing, but this blu-ray will upconvert DVDs to 1080p. DVDs look great. The BD390 can also output either 24 or 60 Hz video. If you intend to have the HDMI AND component video hooked up, then component video can only output 480i. Otherwise, if HDMI is not hooked up, component video can output 1080i. HDMI can of course output 1080p.The front display is not kick ask. No way to see the remaining time on a movie or even the duration of a movie through menu options. And when playing USB music, you have to have the TV on. You just cannot navigate the folders without looking at the TV. All you see is the time of play on the front display. I think they could have managed to get the display to show folder and file information on the display. My car stereo can do it. Take away a few thousand hours of development on BD Live and improve the display on the unit. Also, MP3 files only show the file name on TV. It does not read the MP3 metadata tag information, which is really better for getting the artist and song title.One thing that is really kick ask is how the BD390 does firmware updates. You may say, ""Who cares."" Well you should. How long do you expect to keep your BD390? Do you really think Netflix Watch Instantly will remain the same service in the next five years or so? Will Vudu even still be in business? Well, interfaces to these services will evolve over time. New services could become available. The BD390 will need firmware updates to keep up. If you have ever done a firmware update on a non-internet enabled blu-ray player, you know it is a pain in the ask. You have to download from the internet the updated firmware, burn to a CD, then insert in player and turn unit on. The BD390 checks for updates when you turn it on. If it determines there are updates, it asks you if you want to do the update. It then goes on the internet, downloads the new firmware, and then installs it. Very painless. Totally kick ask.So I have nit-picked a bit, but over all, the BD390 is kick ask. Netflix is just awesome.-- Begin Update 12/16/2009 --I have since down graded my rating to 4 stars. This Blu-ray player has since locked up twice. Once when doing stuff with the set up menus. Another time when just turning the TV on while it was playing music. When you turn on the TV, something goes on with the HDMI. Somehow this caused it to freeze and I had to shut it off and turn it back on. Combined with the hit and miss stop position memory (which is a defect in my opinion since it is inconsistent), and now these freezes, I cannot justify a five star rating anymore.-- End Update 12/16/2009  --",How is the unit?,[],[],[],[],[]

It's a surprisingly limited class, given current trends in home theaters and media consumption. I've listed another contender, below.First, note that I have the white K400R. The R indicates the updated keyboard, with some reprogrammable features, and which has volume controls on the F10-F12 keys. The older K400 has volume controls on the hotkey buttons, above. At this writing, Amazon offers either black or white versions of the keyboard, BUT, the black one is the K400, and the white one is the K400R.The keyboard layout is not full-sized. It's just a bit larger than the one on my Asus EeePC netbook. I have no problem with this size, though some users may find it too small. Some have complained about the stretch required to get to the right shift key. While it IS a stretch, the smaller overall size of the keyboard makes the stretch not as bad as it may appear. Keystroke feel is pretty good. Build quality is pretty good. You get some minor creaks when picking it up in various ways, but, picking it up with one hand -- thumb under the touchpad -- is solid enough.For me, a keyboard that lacks dedicated Page Up, Page Down, Home and End keys is a non-starter. For that reason, I had always avoided the K400. I decided to give the K400R a try, when I learned that it is ""programmable."" Well, it is sort of programmable: 3 hotkey buttons (media player, PC lock, PC sleep) and 6 function keys (F1-F6) can be reconfigured with Logitech's downloadable Setpoint software. Note that the Home button can NOT be reassigned.I set up the F1 and F2 keys as Page Up and Page Down. The F3 and F4 keys became Home and End. To help identify their function, I put thin strips of colored electrical tape on the button risers (I'll try to add a photo). [Unfortunately, these new navigation keys do not work with the control or shift key, such as when selecting text.] I set F5 to be WMC toggle between full-screen and window mode. F6 is set to be quick skip (aka skip ahead, aka ad skip).When Googling for keystrokes necessary to program F5 and F6, I discovered two things about Windows Media Center. 1) There are keyboard shortcuts available for all operations we might want to accomplish with dedicated media keys. Nice. You could actually live without a ""media keyboard,"" if you don't mind using the control- and alt- shifted keystrokes. 2) The quick skip interval can be modified with the skipaheadinterval registry setting (exercise caution; and, Google for full instructions). Instead of the default 30 seconds, skipping ads in recorded programs might be easier if set to skip 60 seconds, or even 3 minutes.The next issue some people have expressed with this keyboard is that the FN key must be pressed to get regular F1-F12 keystokes, since the media and windows functions have been set for non-FN priority. Fortunately, this can be reversed in Setpoint. BTW, Setpoint may not immediately offer configuration options on new setups. It seems you must first use the software to unpair and then re-establish connection (using another keyboard or mouse), before all options are shown.In spite of my tendency to frequently use the F5 and F11 keys, I decided to maintain priority for the media keys. To avoid having to FN shift for F5 and F11, I set the PC lock and PC sleep buttons to provide those functions.The touchpad has a good feel for general use and 2-finger scroll. Pinch-zoom works, but, I've never had that before, so can't compare feel.There are 2 significant problems with the touchpad, which I have decided to live with. They are known issues, as they have appeared in problem reports on the Logitech support forum. 1) The 2-finger right-click often does not work. It appears to vary depending on window focus, or use of 2-finger scroll. It's so bad, I'd rather use my thumb on the right mouse button, below the touchpad. 2) While double-tap-drag does work for some things, like moving a window by the title bar, it does NOT work to resize a window. Resizing becomes a 2-hand operation, though the left mouse button on the top left corner makes it less awkward than if using the touchpad's left button.Some users might find happiness with the Ortek WKB-2000, currently listed on Amazon as ""2.4GHz RF Wireless Keyboard with Smart Touchpad Mouse for MCE Media Center Edition"". I could not get the 2-finger scroll to work. From reading reviews, and through my own efforts, I discovered there is no good driver for Windows 7, 64-bit.The best keyboard I've had is listed on Amazon as ""RK728 Wireless Keyboard"". Mine just died, and it was a great loss! Unfortunately, it is not currently available, even on the 'bay. That may be because of quality control problems. I knew mine would not last forever, and had tried twice to buy a backup. But, both failed in a few days, and were returned.Also noteworthy, is the Adesso WKB-4000UB. It has a great form factor, good key action, and is currently available, but, it has no media keys. Worse than that, the touchpad seems to be pretty low resolution, and, about half the time, tap to click does not register, so, I have to move the pointer slightly, and tap again. For that reason, I just use it as a backup. Mine is several years old, so, it is possible that the touchpad has been improved. Oh, and the touchpad has a scroll zone on the right edge, rather than 2-finger scroll.3 1/2 stars would be the best rating for the K400R.",How did you like the device?,[],[],[],[],[]

This remote is being used to control : Hitachi 32HDL51 TV, DishNetwork DVR-625, Sony STR-DA7ES receiver, JVC HR-S9911U VHS, HP Z540 computer, Archos AV-500 PVR and an X10 light controller.  So far the only problem I've had is with the X10 controller, but I haven't put any time into debugging it.The computer I am using for programming the remote is a Dell E521 ( AMD 64X2 5600+ processor ) running Windows XP Pro SP2. Installing and running the software was quite straightforward ( I'm on a 3Mbps DSL connection ).  I find the software to be fairly intuitive, but did note the ""strange"" English that other reviewers have mentioned.The only glitch I ran into when doing the initial setup for the remote was that the software wanted to ""read"" some of the signals for the DVR-625 and the Sony receiver though I had checked before buying the remote to make sure they were supported.  It then occurred to me that both of these units have TWO remote controls ( both have two-room capability ).  The software was just checking to see which remote I was using.  BUT that showed me that the folks who have complained about the remote's learning capability have legitimate concerns.  I have had a number of teachable remotes, and this is the first one I've had a problem with.  The main problem seemed to be lighting - I had to turn off a lamp about 3 feet away before I had any success at all.  Then, if I had the remotes about 3"" apart, and pressed the button for no more than 1 second, the signals were received ok.  This is the main reason for a 4 star rating rather than 5 star.I spent most of today setting up the ""favorite channels"" on the remote.  The only reason it took so long was that I searched the web for appropriate icons to use, then had to edit them to get 75x44 pixel images ( don't try to use any other size - the icons ""stretch"" to fit 75x44 ).  A really good source for ""nice"" icons is [...]After getting the icons, setting up the favorite channels feature was a breeze.  And, best of all, it actually works.As far as the physical design of the remote, I find it very easy to use.  A lot of thought went into the placement of the buttons, and I have no trouble using it with ""one hand operation"".  The remote I replaced with this one was also a touch-screen ( rather old Sony one ), so I have no problem with the touch-screen.  I also have fairly small fingers, so that may help!  It is a fairly small screen.  I find the lighted buttons to be extremely useful, and it's pretty neat that they turn on as soon as you pick up the remote.  I can't comment too much on the battery life, since I've only had it for 3 days.  But the battery indicator hasn't moved very far from full during that time.In conclusion, I'm quite satisfied with this remote.  Before buying one, make sure it will control your components with a minimum of ""teaching"", because that's a real bummer.  You can check all your components on Logitech's home page.Added after initial review:  Just noticed the remote wasn't really turning the DishNetwork DVR on or off.  The ""help"" and ""device"" could turn it on/off, but not the ""activity"".  I wasn't able to correct the problem with any of the adjustments, but the setup allows one to add steps to activities.  I added a ""select"" to turn it on and ""power toggle"" to turn it off.  Now it works fine.",Is the software included good?,"['the software was quite straightforward'

There are many people out there trying to make the decision of the 3 wonderful cameras. I can only share my analysis based on my need and experience, as an avid amateur photographer.D600: the solid pro-sumer body feels the same as D7000, which I also own. Nikon transplanted the FX heart into a DX body. It is very natural for D7000 owners to upgrade to D600 for the ease of use on functions and layouts. However, I dislike the AF system concentrating mainly in the center, which can be challenging when trying to focus under certain situations. In addition, the problem of the occasional oil spell/dust on the sensor issue can be an indication of quality control problem of this model. I have tried to clean camera sensors before; it is far from easy to do so, wet or dry method. Therefore, most professionals dissuade the general public to do so and recommend leaving the job to the authorized dealers. Believe me, it is beyond annoying when you see spots on your pictures; and sometimes the spots appear in the place that can be very hard to correct.D800: nice pro heavy body with a huge 36mp sensor. Upgrading from a DX, I can not justify spending (jumping) thus much on such a powerful camera. Instead, as most professional photographers suggest, I will spend more on quality lenses, which usually out-last the cameras. If you own D800, you'd better have pro lenses. Otherwise, all the ""defects"" will show up in pictures with its huge and powerful sensor. In addition, D800 also has its own quality control issues, which is back focusing. Also, as an amateur, I tend to shoot more pictures than the pros, making sure I get the pictures I want. Therefore, I end up with a good number of pictures after an assignment and it takes time to process them. I am not ready to store (space-wise) and process (time-wise) big files from the D800 yet... maybe much later.D700: I picked this ""old"" camera over the two new models. It is a pro body, weather sealed, similar weight to D800. The layout is not too different from D7000 (thank goodness!) and easy to get used to. Since it is discontinued, the price dropped to the level that it is quite affordable, especially used ones, though be careful with the ""used"" condition, as it varies A LOT! This is the trial-and-true cameras, a work horse for many professionals. Despite having an older sensor, D700 still can produce exceptional images with wonderful sharpness and color rendition. Pairing it with the right lenses, you get ""gallery"" quality photos/prints. I don't worry too much of the ""small"" 12 mp sensor. As an amateur, most of us don't print over 2'x3' anyway. Its renowned focus system is outstanding, right on everything every time I shoot!I care about the image quality (what my eyes can see), body built (how my hands feel), and the focus system (the first and foremost ingredient in sharp image). I believe all these 3 cameras are capable of producing excellent pictures. Currently, the D700 fits my need, my budget, and the overall quality I am looking for. After all, all the equipments are ""tools"" at best. It is the photographer that takes good or bad pictures. A soft but well-composed picture is not as bad as a sharp yet meaningless one.",How was the camera?,"['I believe all these 3 cameras are capable of producing excellent pictures'

Keep in mind, I came straight over from primarily using HDDs for my mass storage devices, thus the difference to me was more noticeable than for someone moving between SSDs (depending on their quality, of course.) For those who are more technically inclined or interested, I will paste benchmark data for the drive's performance at the end of the review.The design of the drive is very sleek and stylish. It boasts a smooth, polished, black exterior to house the powerful internals. You see what you expect out of an SSD: a lot of performance using a very small amount of space. I was a little bummed when I had to install it out of view as it was quite pleasant to look at.Installation is simple just like any other SATA drive; plug it into your motherboard and power supply, and you'll be smooth sailing from there.I'll discuss performance in terms of what's visibly noticeable, and following the conclusion, as aforementioned I will post benchmark results. From the moment I power on, to when I reach the login screen is only a span of about ten seconds or so (possibly slightly less); this is honestly a very quick process. If I didn't have a password lock, I would obviously boot into my system much quicker without having to input the keystrokes for the password. After I log in, I am instantly able to begin opening programs, and they load quickly. Anything from Firefox or Chrome, my large Steam library, or large movie files. I have not attempted to utilize any hungry video/photo editing programs, but you can rest assured that your loading times with those would be low as well. Furthermore, I play very high performing games such as Skyrim with high-res texture mods, Battlefield 3, and Anno 2070 to name a few.When considering this SSD for purchase, keep in mind the cost per GB when thinking about what size of SSD to get. Of course, if you just want to boot your OS quickly and some important high performance programs, you are likely better off with a smaller SSD with a larger HDD to store other files. In my case, I've installed the OS, all of my programs, and games to the SSD, while having a couple of other much larger HDDs to store the large movie files, music libraries, etc. Keep in mind, I don't install all of my games simultaneously to allow more room for other purposes. I purchased this SSD during a sale, thus granting me a better value per GB of space on this 256gb drive. If budgeting is important, considering waiting for a big sale as an option. Should money not be a concern, Samsung will be releasing high performance 1TB SSDs to the market for a much higher price point, but you will be able to get HDD storage sizes with the incredible speeds of an SSD.In summary, purchasing this SSD will not disappoint you or your wallet. You get a nicely designed product with stellar performance at a great price point, especially during a good sale. If you're coming from primarily using HDDs, you will be blown away by the colossal difference in speeds. In most cases, price will be the major deciding factor between what size of SSD to purchase. With this particular drive size, it would behoove you to consider using it in tandem with a HDD of a much larger storage capacity.Pros:-Amazing, noticeable performance, especially if coming from HDD usage-Stylish design-Great value per GB, especially if purchased during a saleCons:None encounteredBechmark:As promised, here are the results I obtained from running CrystalDiskMark:Sequential Read :  503.236 MB/sSequential Write :  478.656 MB/sRandom Read 512KB :  447.499 MB/sRandom Write 512KB :  154.937 MB/sRandom Read 4KB (QD=1) :  31.125 MB/s [  7598.8 IOPS]Random Write 4KB (QD=1) :  99.221 MB/s [ 24223.9 IOPS]Random Read 4KB (QD=32) :  337.172 MB/s [ 82317.5 IOPS]Random Write 4KB (QD=32) :  141.240 MB/s [ 34482.4 IOPS]Finally, as a reference point, these are the specs of the system I use this SSD with:Gigabyte Z87X-UD4H moboIntel i7 4770k 3.5GhzCoolermaster Hyper 212 EvoGigabyte GeForce GTX 770 4GBCorsair Vengeance 2x4GB (8gb) 1600mhz 9-9-9-24Samsung 840 PRO 256gb SSD(primary)Seagate barracuda 500gb 5400rpm HDD (data storage)Western Digital 1gb HDD (data storage)Samsung 24x DVD driveCorsair HX750Coolermaster Storm Trooper",What is the quality of the software?,['very sleek and stylish'],[514],[1],[0.65],[ True]

Before I bought it, I read some other reviewers that suggested using the elastic band to bind back the cover when reading. As in, open the cover all the way until it touches the back cover and flip the band around it to hold it there. This works great. The cover is nice and stiff which seems to provide good protection. The light, for me, works really great. It is really convenient not having to have a separate light and/or batteries. Some reviewers have complained about the included LED light being unevenly distributed. This is true, but mine doesn't seem to be in any way that bad. I played with the light (it slides out on a molded flat plastic arm in the top right hand corner of the back), and see that if the light is angled just a little bit more down or up it changes the light distribution considerably. Which leads me to wonder if the lights that are giving the most problems are just off-angled. Anyway, it is just a thought.

Chose the ASUS Black Knight N66U router as our primary networking device, a dual band 450 Mbps device, which then led to the need for higher speed wireless adapters on a few key computers to take advantage of the higher router speeds, and after much research, chose the TRENDnet 450's to match the router specs.  Have installed these on work laptop and audio workstation desktop so far, and will purchase another for home server when get that up and running.Honestly, I've been moving away from the old stalwarts like Netgear, Dlink, and especially LinkSys (after Cisco acquisition), as I don't think they are on the leading edge of performance, reliability, and ease of use any more.  TRENDnet, on the other hand, seems to be on the rise, and offering good price/performance, especially on the adapter side.  Had a TRENDnet 300 Mbps 2.4GHz dongle that worked very well, so that and reviews led me to the 684UB.Conclusion, the TRENDnet 684UB is an very good low priced choice!  However, for MAXIMUM throughput, get the slightly more expensive but worth it Asus USB-N66ASUS Dual-Band Wireless-N900 USB Network Adapter (USB-N66)First and foremost, am getting much higher link speeds than via old N and G adapters linked to my previous dual band N router (Netgear WNDR3700 dual band 300Mbps).  Am seeing up to the rated 450 Mbps link speed with the TRENDnet 684UB working with the Asus Black Knight, especially on 5GHz band, and had never exceeded 100 Mbps with previous setup.  2.4 GHz link speeds are up as well, 50-100%, despite the crowding in that band in general and where I live specifically.  I know link speeds are not the same as throughput, BUT, throughput is some *fraction* of link speed, so, if you don't get the higher link speed, you are limiting throughput as well, and now, I can work with the maximum *potential* speed that 802.11N currently provides.  Have not done formal speed/throughput benchmarking, but will update this review if I do.  Real world speed FEELS fast, and much faster than previous setup.Second, these adapters are really small!  No, they are not a USB dongle in size, but I want speed first and foremost for this application, and the device just needs some physical size for antennas to send and receive at these new higher 802.11N speeds.Setup was drop dead easy, just downloaded the latest driver and utility bundle from the TRENDnet site (I almost never use included CDs with devices, as the drivers are almost always out of date), installed, plugged in, and connected to my router with WPA2-PSK security (this specific security protocol is necessary to get to the top speeds in the 802.11N spec).Another cool thing I am testing is on my laptop, where I have both the built-in dual band 300 Mbps Intel radio and now the TRENDnet both operating simultaneously.  Have not done any benchmarks yet that would measure the benefits of such a setup, but I'm intrigued.  And it's just plain cool to have 2.4 and 5 GHz connections show up simultaneously in Windows wifi taskbar app.Summing up...Pros+ True 450 Mbps link speeds on 5GHz band in real world (router two rooms away thru three walls)+ Very small size - 3"" tall by 2"" wide+ Can locate device for optimum reception via USB cable+ GREAT price+ Easy setup, can be managed by Windows or through optional utility software+ Looks like a high tech shark fin :-)Cons- Throughput drops under load, as noted by others elsewhere (- 1 star).- Utility software is kind of primitive, but seems to work fine.  I did notice at one point that I had to enter my SSID password in both the TRENDnet utility and Windows Wireless Networking for things to work right, but kinda serves me right for leaving both enabled - heh hehTips* Location/orientation.  Move the adapter around, changing orientation, height, location, to get the best signal, and watch the link speed change to see which location provides best link speed.  I just held the adapter in many different positions for a few seconds and eyeballed the average link speed to find out what was best.  Turned out location/orientation within the range of the bundled USB cable could affect speed by  as much as 50%!  For me, higher was better (perhaps obviously), and the best orientation was sideways hanging off the edge of my 26"" LCD, with the lights facing down.  Hmmm... but it works.* Tune your router.  The router is of course the other key enabler of overall network performance.  Each router is different, but on the Asus Dark Knight I'm using the already mentioned WPA2-PSK security on both bands, 40MHz channel width on 5GHz band, and 20/40 Auto on the 2.4 GHz band, and, critically, power output turned up to the 200 mW maximum.  The latter REALLY helps both bands, but especially the 5GHz link speeds.Highly recommend the 684UB for those who have dual band 450 Mbps routers and need a high performance, reasonably priced adapter to match.",What is the quality of the product?,[],[],[],[],[]

Upload the songs to this flash drive and then you don't have to worry about removing it in and out since it's very tiny. If you hook it to your laptop, it's hardly visible. It's hard to damage tiny drive such as this because it's not a long stick where you can just bump into it and it snap out of your laptop or worse, breaks. The main concern for this product is that it will likely disappear on you if you're not careful where you left your things. So the best use for it is on something you don't often remove it from. That way it won't get lost and can fool a naked eye. I had it in my car stereo no one notice it's a flash drive.Here are some suggesting for going with this flash drive or a standard size.Reasons for owning this drive. Store it for fun things like music, photos, video clip, or things you want to share with others. Buy the 8GB or 16GB version so you don't have to stored too many things in one place. If you needed a bigger space, get a portable hard drive. Flash drive isn't meant for large storage due to the slow speed. You wouldn't want to upload HD contents because it will take you longer then you would expect. If you want it for storing songs for your car, the smaller the size the better. Reason is your stereo play have limitation to number of folder and size. It make no sense have large space when you're stereo cannot handle it. Small files will do nicely on this kind of drive.Reasons you shouldn't buy it. If you're planning on storing sensitive data, I highly recommend you to look for something that's hard to lose or have a very strong attachment to your keys or other belongings you often carry with you.

Let me tell you something: I had NO idea what I was missing! If I'd realized how great these headsets were, I would have purchased them for myself a long time ago.In the few days I have had them, I've easily used them for several multi-hour sessions (watching movies at night on my Tablet or music on my phone) with NO discomfort. In fact, I find it difficult to find earbuds small enough to comfortably fit my ears for more than a half an hour, but the default installed earbuds fit perfectly! (There are two additional, larger sets included).On top of that, at night I put on a movie or show on Netflix to fall asleep to, but wear headphones so as to not wake my spouse. Prior to receiving these, my favorite set have been a wired set of Vizio, which, if I rolled to my side, would become uncomfortable in the ear pressed into my pillow, and are often yanked out as the wire would get tangled up as I rolled around in my sleep.These have such a low profile in the ear that there is no pressure or discomfort when laying on my side. Even more impressive is that they remain in place even after moving around in my sleep. I just remove them on my first arousal after falling asleep. Even after using them the night before, I can use them the following day for several hours before recharging them for the next night.Ultimately, after only a few days, I purchased this model, the Tone+ (HBS-730), but kept the HBS-700 model for my spouse. The Tone+ solves my only gripe with the standard model: the lack of a mute; a necessary feature for professional conference calls. The Tone+ also add several improvements including a vibration alert for incoming calls and best of all, the ability for the Tone+ to be actively paired with 2 devices simultaneously (be it 2 phones or a phone and a tablet, for example).I am simply stunned by the quality and features available for the Tone+ given the price. It's hard to find a quality set of wired headsets, or a single-ear headset for this price.In short, I am very impressed and am very happy with this product that I use daily.PROs:+Extremely comfortable.+Very good sound quality for the average user.+Impressive battery life.+Simultaneous active pairing to 2 devices+OUTSTANDING VALUE (hard to beat the price/quality even compared to a quality wired headset)NEUTRAL:=Noise-blocking earbuds. Great for focusing on a conversation or your media. However, less useful for use with a Playstation and dangerous if used while driving (I have a standard headset for these situations).=The thin wire connecting the earbuds to the base may not be as durable long-term as some heavier-duty wired earbuds. However, there is almost never any tension on the earbud wires. But, given that I use them to sleep, I've purchased a 3-year replacement plan through Squaretrade for $10 (30% off) that even covers wear and tear.=SMS Text Reader app was not personally tested, but Android Play Store reviews seem to indicate that the required app is hit or miss based on your specific device.CONs:-Sound quality may not stack up for a true audiophile.-The Bluetooth connection can be tempermental. Even the human body, if place between the device and the headset (such as putting your phone in a back pocket) has the potential to interfere with the signal. This is personally a rare problem, but a surprising one when it occurs.",What do you think of the artistic design?,[],[],[],[],[]

This is smaller and cools better, probably because it uses copper pipes instead of aluminum like the previous cooler. Fan noise is average, no different than the old fan. I have a big tower case so there is plenty of room for a large cooler like this. With a smaller more compact case you may want to check your clearance first. On the box it says it's 158.5mm tall, 120.0mm wide, 77.0mm deep.I like that the fan easily separates from the fins for cleaning, unlike my old cooler. It just clips on the side using no screws. Big plus for that design. You can put the fan on either side, but you want the air to flow in the same direction as your case fans.Comes with a variety of mounting hardware for different Intel and AMD CPUs. You can also position it to blow vertically or horizontally, depending on which way you want the air to flow. Although the mounting instructions are not that great at first glance, it did not take long to figure out what parts to use and how to use them. If this is your first time mounting a cooler, you don't need/want to overtighten the screws. Just snug will do nicely. You don't want to crack your motherboard and/or damage the internal wiring running by the screw holes. This isn't your car you are working on.I used Arctic Silver 5 instead of the included thermal paste. Go to Arctic's website for the correct way to apply it as it's different for each cpu type. My i7-920 is quad core so it calls for a side-to-side bead instead of a pea-sized drop in the middle. There are how-to videos and pics out there if this is your first time.SpeedFan 4.49 says my idle temp is 35C, and while running Prime95 it goes no higher than 61C. Intel says the absolute max i7 temp is 100C, which if ever reached, the software should shut everything down to protect the chip. Btw, they say it helps to 'burn in' the thermal paste by running Prime95 or whatever, as repeated heating and cooling actually makes the paste work better, but if you don't overclock then that's not really needed.I wanted to move to water cooling but read how some have leaked and the liquid destroyed very expensive video cards (seems they are always mounted below the cpu on a vertical motherboard). I have not heard if the cooler's manufacturers offer any kind of reimbursement for the damage, but who wants the hassle? I'm guessing the only way to avoid that is to lay the desktop on it's side where everything is hanging upside down from the motherboard. I'd rather have my tower case upright so I guess I'll stick to fans.",How is the instruction?,[],[],[],[],[]

The cinema view (no frame around the edge of the screen) is very nice, and everyone who sees it notices it right off the bat and makes a complimentary comment.The colors are fantastic, and clarity, too.  One problem with this is that you can TOTALLY tell when a television show is not filmed in true HD (ie 720p instead of 1080p)...so not all ""HD"" channels are truly HD...The remote interface is cool.  Very much like the Wii, it's a point and click, as in you get an arrow that moves around and like a wand, you just aim and click.  There are many apps, including Hulu and Hulu Plus, etc. (They are listed above, so I won't bore you.)  Be aware, if you do not have very high speed internet service, you will have trouble with streaming HD movies.Setting up the WiFi is easy.  Just follow the directions and be sure your router is set to ""pair"".  Be sure you have the WPA code available, too.The sound is great--and I LOVE the option to amp up voices.  I have a problem with my hearing and cannot hear mid-range tones (voices).  I have always had trouble with normal TV's.  Not this one.  Awesome.Watching movies is clear, and the 2D-to-3D feature works amazingly well!  (Better than the new Titanic movie, I can tell you that...the one they just redid in 3D...)  I'm impressed!The 3D movies make you want to reach out and touch someone.  Really.The glasses are really nice!  They are light and you don't realize they are on after awhile.  Unlike the old-school 3D TV's, you don't need batteries.  And getting 6 pair is a super deal.I left it on for hours, to see if it got hot (like some other TV's do).  It did not.  Very nice.Now, the bad...(Yup, there's bad...and no matter what I did, I couldn't get around it.)The black depth could be better.  It's more like dark gray.  I turned off the backlight (it's annoying to me) and still I don't get the depth I'd expect from a TV.When the TV shows a black (yes, dark-gray, but for all intents it ""thinks"" it's black) you see various halos around the screen's edge.  At first there was just one.  Now there are 6.  I called customer service, and they were NOT HELPFUL at all.  I had the TV for a day and called, and still they tried to blame it on using HDMI cables, instead of the supplied component cables.  I switched to component, and the halo was still there.  I switched back and it didn't change.  Nothing to do with cables.  I googled it and it seems that this is a common problem.  But LG threatened to charge me if I asked someone to come check it out.  Not cool.  Even when I told them that I was reviewing it here, they didn't seem to care.Obviously, I am not going to pay to have someone come out...So, the bottom line is that it's a great TV, but not perfect.  If you're into deep colors, you have to really play with it to get it, and still your blacks could be better.  The halos drive me batty, but not enough to get rid of the TV.  They do not show up when there is an actual show on--only when it's a black screen, like the menu or when you turn the cable box off and you get the blank screen.The voice-option makes it a winner to me.  The 3D is amazing.",How black is this color?,[],[],[],[],[]

I didn't find any need to do that to this router since it has a built-in bandwidth monitor and VPN. I also setup the built in FTP server and attached a small 16GB memory stick to it.

I've used it for one day on my PC at work and the rest of the time at home on my Mac, running OS 10.6 Snow Leopard.  In both Win and Mac OS, i had instant functionality when i plugged in the mouse.  The special buttons don't start working until after you install the Logitech software, but basic point and click stuff works fine, which was nice.Compared to my Apple Mighty Mouse, this thing is nice because it works the instant you turn on the mouse.  No waiting for bluetooth to sync with the computer, etc.  I installed the mouse drivers on both platforms and not surprisingly, they ""feel"" different.  For example, i like the simplicity and look of the the Mac version of the driver.  There is a BUT here though....  In the Win version, the forward/backward buttons can be easily set as... forward and backward buttons for a browser.  The Mac version has no such default, and i had to tell it to do a keystroke instead, which still accomplishes the same thing.  It's not a huge deal, but a pretty odd omission for something that should be rather obvious.  Not everyone out there knows the keyboard commands for forward/backward.  Wish they made this a bit more foolproof.The feel of the mouse is very good, but i have medium/large hands.  If you have small hands, this mouse will feel huge.  You might consider other Logitech products if that's the case.  It is a very ergonomic shape and i find it comfy.  I love the thumb rest/button.  They got this one right.  It's hard enough to press that it doesn't fire off accidentally, but also doesn't require tons of pressure to activate.  I use it on my Mac to do Expose, but it could be programmed to do anything.  The Windows version of the driver has an Expose-like feature, but it's not nearly as nice as the Mac OS version of it.  Perhaps Windows 7 will have cooler visuals.All in all, the buttons feel pretty good, except for the scroll wheel.  The scrolling is fine, but does seem a bit clunky for a ""top shelf"" mouse such as this.  It feels clunky and sounds that way, too.  If you need a mouse that scrolls quietly, this isn't it.  My logitech keyboard/mouse combo my work has feels better in the wheel department.  The middle button is what really blows on this mouse.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.  Sometimes i apply moderate pressure to the wheel and the middle button works.  Other times i feel like i'm going to break the mouse to get it to work.  For this reason, i reprogrammed the ""zoom"" button just below the forward/backward buttons to be my middle button.  I had no use for the zoom, so it works out well.  The zoom button has a great feel.  So, if you just simply can't live with a mouse that has a crappy middle button, you may want to look elsewhere.  Everything else i felt was well put together and seems to work well.  I tend to use the middle button for Google SketchUP, as it's used for panning the 3D model.  It has other uses, which are probably not important to the vast majority of users.  Heck, on a Mac, Apple used to think ONE button was enough on a mouse.  Silly Steve....  I now have 7 buttons and it all works pretty darn well.I think most people will find this mouse very nice and probably worth the cost.  The new ""unifying receiver"" is just freaking tiny!  The receiver is smaller than the USB plug it's attached to.  It just disappears underneath my aluminum Apple keyboard.  Range on the receiver is good also.  I tested it about 8 feet away and it works flawlessly.  I also tested the mouse on glass.  Yes, it works and works well.",How is the control?,[],[],[],[],[]

I've owned 5 of the past Canon digital elph's (the most recent the SD790is), and I just returned the Canon SD940is.  I am blown away by the panasonic ZS3!  It does everything the Canon does, and more.  First, the response time of the camera is excellent:  shutter lag is minimal, autofocus is very quick, flash recharge times are quick as well.  I felt the Canon 940 was inferior to even the 790 in shutter lag and autofocus (I was missing shots waiting for the camera to fix on the subject).  The Panasonic has more pleasing photo quality, albeit slightly softer than the Canon.  Colors are more vibrant on the Panasonic, as is overall tone.  I feel like I don't have to mess with the image on the Panasonic like I did with the Canon.  Overall, a great point and shoot.Now for the true differentiating feature.....  This camera doubles as an excellent video camera.  I am blown away by the quality of the video captured in the AVCHD-lite format.  Even in low light situations, the video blows away any other point and shoot, and rivals the super compact $1000 Sony TG-5.  Where it surpasses the TG-5 is in the optical stabilization; the Panasonic shows far less handshake than the TG-5 (which is a huge issue for these ultra compact video cameras).  Finally, there is a point and shoot camera that can capture excellent video for those times where you don't want to drag along a larger video camera.  I own the Sony CX-12 AVCHD camcorder, and the Panasonic is not in the same league as that camcorder.  However, playing the files I shot with the Panasonic on western digital's WDTV via HDMI, video looks fantastic: sharp, vibrant colors with smooth panning.  I would not feel bad trading the portability of the Panasonic, and leaving the Sony camcorder at home (unless I was on a trip to Ireland or something of the like).  The video is truly remarkable for the size of the camera.Also worth noting; Panasonic was very smart to include HD motion JPEG as an option for video recording.  So if AVCHD-lite isn't your thing, you can capture HD video footage in the mp4 quicktime format.  I will say, however, the video is cleaner and smoother when shot in AVCHD-lite.Overall, for the cost of the camera, you cannot go wrong.  It is an excellent point and shoot with very responsive shooting times, and a great portable HD camcorder to boot.  I never thought I would own (or like) a Panasonic camera!Pros:Wide angle lenseExcellent image stabilizationExcellent AVCHD-lite video cameraExcellent shooting timesGreat battery lifeFull Zoom ability while video recordingCons:LCD screen resolution not the crispest I've seenSome images could use sharpeningMenu system a bit cumbersomeLarger than most point and shootsManual exposure in video mode would be nice",Does the video and pictures extremely sharp?,"[""the competition in point and shoot camera's""]",[39],[1],[0.],[False]

I can read Kindle format books and if I want to read non-Kindle format books I can read them on the ereader that is built into the Overdrive program, which is their console so I can read Kindle and Epub formats right on my Kindle Fire HD.  The ereader function of the Kindle Fire is very good.  The screen is bright, not much glare at all, tap to turn pages, easy dictionary access, bookmarking etc functions.  I also like how secure it is.  I have placed a password on it.  Its very easy to figure out and use.UPDATE:  I bought the ihome alarm/clock charger for this on Amazon.  See my review.  Its great.

I haven't had a Sony console since the PS2 and my most recent console was the Xbox 360.  The console arrived on time for launch day and was a breeze to set up.  The Playstation Network (PSN) was more than a bit congested due to the massive number of accounts hitting it within the 24 hour launch day.I was able to set up my console and download the initial software update with no problems.  Getting my PSN account logged in took a bit of time, but that was to be expected given the high demand for the system and large network traffic.  Since I couldn't access the store from the console, I opted to use the nifty feature of purchasing a digital game through Sony's website and setting it to download to the PS4.  That bypassed the traffic and immediately started the download to the console.  The play while you download feature is nice, but be aware that you need to download a specified portion of the game before you can start.  With a retail size game, that still takes time.  My example was Battlefield 4.  6GB is necessary to start playing.  You can then play single player while the remaining 33GB downloads.The hardware itself is pretty great.  I love the simple design of the case and the power is a sufficient leap over the previous generation of consoles that it makes it worth it.  The DualShock4 controller takes a bit of getting used to if you have been using an Xbox controller, but it's a great controller.  I haven't used the touchpad yet, but it's a potentially interesting feature.  The triggers are different, but I think they are quite adequate for my primary gaming need - shooters.The user interface is simplistic, but everything seems sorted into logical areas.  I've only got about 8 hours into usage, so my experience is still that of a new user.Included in the box is a 30-day trial for PS+, which is required for online multi-player.  You also get some pretty great games free every month.  I already have a favorite launch game and it was free - Resogun.  There is also a 30-day trial of Sony's streaming music service.  I tested it out briefly and it works well, though I'm not sure I'd subscribe to it after the trial is up.The best part is that I was able to set up a PSN account for my wife so she can access everything I can but there is no fee for her account.  Also, Sony has not put any of the media streaming services not owned by Sony (Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Instant, etc.) behind a paywall.  This simplifies multiple accounts on the console accessing streaming media.Overall, I'm very satisfied with my purchase and I highly recommend a Playstation 4 to people looking at upgrading to a next-gen console.",Why is it a good hardware?,['The hardware itself is pretty great.

Often I use the two-way audio to give them commands.  The original setup was not that difficult if you follow the instructions.  On my network it has a static IP and port mapping allows me to make it available over the Internet.The night vision works well, but does tend to see-through certain thin clothing.  This isn't a big issue, but it is worth noting that it may not be appropriate in some use cases.  During the day the color tends to falter leaving it a little washed out.My experience is that at 12 feet in darkness you can no longer distinguish between objects 1-2 inches in size.  To frame this, if you put a $1 bill on the floor next to a $20 bill you would struggle to identify which is which.  At 20 feet in darkness you will lose edge definition on items.  Anything beyond tends to reach the limit of the infrared range.In bright light you will add a couple of feet to each of the measures above.  The reason for mentioning this is that you may not want to locate the camera in a ceiling where it is inherently 10-12 feet away from any relevant objects.  Also, the camera as pictured with the product has the base pointed down.  To gain the most range of freedom you will want to mount the camera upside-down and flip the rotational axis.  This is supported in the software.The video recording features do not appear to work on my firmware.  The snapshot features require you to login before they work.  I had planned to have the stills grabbed every couple of minutes available to the public and the pan/tilt adjustments requiring a password.  To get around this I had to setup a PHP script to authenticate and store the images on a server.  Then people can access the images without logging in.The audio quality of the microphone is reasonable.  The speaker on the camera is poor and I highly recommend that when mounting the camera you add a set of powered speakers available on Amazon for cheap.The only downside is that there is an upper limit on concurrent viewers on the camera.  After five concurrent viewers the camera tends to become non-responsive to commands through the GUI.  The second camera of the same model with the newer firmware does not have this same issue.

Then you need this lens in your collection.  Period.  Don't debate it any longer, just do it.This is a wonderful little lens that will give you levels of sharpness, color, and image quality that will blow most consumer (non-f2.8) zooms out of the water.  If all you've ever used are f3.5-fwhatever zoom lenses, you're in for a real treat with this lens.  AF is as fast as any other Nikkor AF-S lens, and the fast f1.8 grabs shots in low light that will blow your mind.Of course, it's just a fixed 35mm.  A prime.  So if you've fallen into 'composure-apathy' that can come from owning a zoom lens, you're going to have to use to learn to to use your feet and actually think about composure a bit.  You've got to walk.  Get close.  Step back.  Think. Compose. Shoot.  It's more work, but the rewards can be magnificent.Lenses are tools.  'Kit' zooms are like a good folding pocket knife; a set of little screwdrivers, a couple of knives, maybe a saw, maybe some scissors, a nail file, etc.  Nice little tools that can come in handy in many situations.  Throw it in your pocket and go.  But when you need a good screwdriver to remove a stubborn screw, or you need to chop down a tree, or remove the engine from a '67 Mustang, that pocket knife isn't the best choice.  A prime lens is like a perfectly weighted and well-made single-purpose tool.  A solid screwdriver.  A perfectly balanced pair of pliers.  A well-engineered ratchet.  It's simple, it's basic, and it's a joy to use.And that's the simple elegance to using a prime lens.Lenses like this and the 50mm f1.8 are small and light.  They barely add anything to the weight and bulk of just the camera body itself, especially if it's a higher-level Nikkor DSLR (D90, D300s).  It's just effortless.  Compared to some of the heavier zooms (16-85, 18-105, 18-200), it'll make your camera feel weightless.  Fantastic for all-day wandering-around photography, assuming you don't need serious wide-angle or serious telephoto.However, this lens is a 'gateway drug'.  It and the 50mm f1.8 both fall into this category.  The low price and amazing IQ hooks you.  ;-)  Use it for a while, and you'll begin to want *all* of your glass to be fast f2.8 (or better), rather than the slow 'consumer' level variable aperture lenses.  And that can quickly become an expensive proposition. :)",How quality is the photo pictures?,['image quality that will blow most consumer'],[199],[1],[0.5],[False]

However, viewing angle may be an issue for purchasers who have seating too far to the side of the screen. Imagine the television at a 6 o'clock position. The picture is fine, if you are seated between the 10 o'clock and 2 o'clock positions, but color begins to fade very noticeably when fanning out further. For those with a shallow viewing distance and wide room, I recommend that you steer clear of the 47HL167. The limited viewing angle is very noticeable to me and was cited by Consumer Reports. Imagine my surprise that hardly any Amazon reviews mention it.The colors are very vivid and the 47HL167 has numerous adjustments to help each viewer satisfy their own preference. I suspect that those who have encountered problems with ""Green or Blue Push"" have not adjusted the settings to their liking, or might possibly have defective sets. I have not noted any ""color issues"", though the 47HL167 does have setting modes labeled ""Cool, Medium, and Warm"" which can render the overall color in the direction of blue or green. Motion blur hasn't been noticeable either. Sharpness is excellent. No blotchiness or muddled lines are present.The blacks are very good and I recommend that you ignore concerns about the black quality of LCD versus Plasma unless you are a very discerning viewer. Grey hued black-levels evident with old and/or cheap LCD screens is not a problem. The only greyness that I have noticed is during credits and pre-movie viewing screens with poor quality DVD recordings. During movie playback blacks are black. Partly due to the LCD technology, but also because of the matte screen coating on this particular model, inky black levels of the highest quality plasma set is not obtainable. Other LCD models may have darker black rendering, but probably giving up the advantage of using the 47HL's matte screen. For most viewers, the difference is marginal enough, that it is only noticeable during side-by-side comparison to another model.Two strong characterstics of the LCD technology and the 47HL in particular should be considered. LCD offers a brighter colors and the matte screen option. Though, the Plasma TV offers a darker black, it is marred by the fact that the screen will reflect light from darker screen shots and appear dim in brightly lit rooms. In fact, the displays at the major retail stores illustrate this phenomenon very readily with multiple TV's broadcasting the same scene. The LCD TV's show little to no lighting glare or reflectivity, while the plasma will reveal the room distinctly in a mirror like fashion. The performance of the 47HL and its matte screen coating is excellent in brightly lit rooms and does not suffer from any mirroring effect. Fast moving action scenes are rendered without flaw. No dead pixels have been observed. The screen is easy to clean.Aside from picture viewing considerations, I can't find reason for complaint. Sound quality is fine, and no abberation (like buzzing cabinet resonance) is apparent. Bass and Treble can be adjusted and the unit also has three separate adjustments for Surround Effects. For movies I turn to my AV Stereo system to provide sound, but for TV broadcasts I find the TV speakers suitable. Three  hdmi inputs are adequate, if not using an AV Receiver to handle connectivity/switching chores. The 47HL167's remote control works fine for me, despite lack of back-lighting. I was able to add codes to control the disc players and satellite receiver, but couldn't get the much loved ""commercial skip"" functionality when watching shows recorded on Dish DVR.The TV includes the noteworthy three HDMI inputs, but has plenty of other connectivity options for non-hdmi equipped components: PC, DVD, cable box and antenna. You should be able to avoid using the composite or S-video inputs which result in much lower video quality. I observed very poor quality with S-video connections to a PC, DVD player, and Satellite DVR. For those computer owners who plan to use DVI adapters, beware that you may lose access to other HDMI inputs, if using an adapter on the TV side of the connection. The HDMI inputs are close together and the width of the DVI male connector and corresponding adapter will block the adjacent HDMI input(s). I recommend spending a few extra dollars and use a cable that transitions from a DVI connector on one end to HDMI on the other.The 47HL167 is very comparable in price to similar models offered by competing brands. Though you'll see it listed as high as $2,100, it is usually priced around $1,800 retai, and there have been several special sales on this TV (the lowest sales offering at $1,299).Also note that the 47HL167 will need about 15 seconds to power up, if in the power saving mode. I have encountered trouble when switching to my DVR before the TV is fully powered up. Switching to the input too quickly sometimes brings up a blank screen and a loud pop is emitted from the speakers, when trying to switch between inputs to correct the problem. At this point you'll have to shut off the TV. An alternative is to put the TV on a power mode setting that starts it more quickly, but prepare for a higher electric bill, since the TV will be using power continuously. I suspect that the issue may be caused by the DVR since the problem is absent when selecting other devices.In summary, I highly recommend the Toshiba Regza for those that view the TV from within the limited viewing angle and plan to watch DVD's and High Definition content. If low price is priority, the Olevia and Vizio are fairly competitive. If picture quality is most important, but at a cost under $1,800, then Samsung may be the better choice. Only highly discerning viewers will enjoy the benefits of a costlier LCD model or want to address the problems with plasma technology.",What are the delivery options?,[],[],[],[],[]

It's one of the few times I received something like this in a ziploc bag (with the DVR in a bubble wrap). Construction is cheap, and although the instructions described an A/V cable, there isn't one in the package. I wasn't planning on connecting this directly to a TV, so I didn't follow up on that.What's included is the DVR, the lithium ion battery, the suction cup mount, a piece of instruction leaflet (English, Chinese and Russian), the car power adapter (very long cord - can be routed to keep it out of the way) and a mini USB cable. You need to open one of the flaps on the side to plug in the USB power cable. The other flap on the opposite side covers the SD card slot.The screen is protected by a sheet of plastic. Removing it was a pain, but take your time so that you don't damage the LCD. The LCD is useful for helping aim the camera, and for settings, but unusable in bright sunlight even inside the car. I went through the menu settings. They're pretty much self explanatory, which is good because the instruction leaflet was no help. You need to supply a full sized SD card. I used a 32 GB card without any problem.There is a 1920x1080 setting for video. When I chose that, it recorded in 1280x720 (NOT 1080p), but at slightly above 30 fps. At the 1280x720 setting, it recorded at just slightly above 29.97 fps.Encoding format is motion JPEG. Video quality is mediocre. Don't count on being able to read license plates, but you can definitely tell what you're seeing. IR, as most people pointed out, is useless, and you can leave it off.Using it is simple. Leave it plugged in. When the car turns on, it powers up the unit which starts recording. When you turn the car off, the unit records for another few seconds, then powers off. Files are 2 mins in length, configurable for longer lengths. Default is to erase older files when the card is full.At just a bit over $20, it's a good DVR to play around with. Probably good enough for insurance purposes, though I'm not sure if it can be used as evidence in court. My guess is that it would probably be good enough to prove your innocence (or at least cast reasonable doubt), but not enough to get someone else convicted. At this price, it is cheap enough to try out, and buy a better unit if you decide this is something you'd like to have.",Is a good quality of memory ?,[],[],[],[],[]

I really like the camera for the ease of use.  All the buttons and menu layout all are well designed and thought out enough, so that if you used a digital camera before, you don't have to read the manuel to figure out how to use all the functions.  I also like the fast start up time, the long battery life, and the various functions like video, continuous shooting mode etc...  None of these functions are unique to Cannon cameras though.

I received this product and right off the bat I liked the packaging and the helpful instructions inside.  After having a chance to use It I was blown away.  It has sturdy construction and the battery life on the keyboard is very nice.  Not to mention rechargeable.  In other products you would have to lug around a keyboard and a case if you wanted something to protect your device and be able to be productive.  With this case it is all in one.  I liked the adjustability of the orientations that the pad could be put in it helps when doing different tasks.  I also liked the adjustability because there are sometimes depending on light and other factors when you need the Ipad to be at a certain angle.I have in the past had a case that did well with protecting it, and had a stand but it was two pieces and the stand was not very adjustable.  I would have to use other small items to prop the screen up further.I also believe this case provides decent protection to my device, although I am not sure I would want to drop it in this case as I think the case would not fully protect it.  But for every day usage I believe that it would hold up.I like the look and feel of the keyboard the layout is nice and they keys are great to type with.  I do not do a lot of writing on my pad but with some of the new apps coming out for the pad I just may start on my memoirs.  Syncing the pad to the keyboard was quick and easy and worked right out of the box with no charging required.  The response of the keys are very fast and I do not even notice the time it take over Bluetooth.New Trent also took care to make sure all of the proper ports were left unobstructed. I even find that most aftermarket cables for the ipad function with this case on.  The one thing I would like to see, and I am not sure if it is even possible would be a all in one usb cord.  One that could connect to a apple charger and into a single usb port instead of having to find two separate ports to use for charging and using the pad.  I do admit that this would be a rare thing but I think it would put this product over the top.I think this product would be great for business men and women, a suitable replacement for a cumbersome laptop or when you just need something small for traveling.  It is a little hard to fit most modern day laptops on a seatback not to mention they are very heavy.

I got an err70 code which required the camera be returned to Canons service center in Irvine CA. I called them up and explained the issue. They gave me free shipping (to print from the printer) for UPS so I packed it up and sent it off to Canon with a letter where I told them how much I loved the camera (I think my compliments and not being pushy made a very big difference). The camera was 2 years old with well over a 100,000 clicks. I receive the news the cost would be about 200 for the repair. When I went to pick it up Canon replaced the shutter and board restoring the camera to like new condition. It would have been fair to bill me more than 1000 for these repairs since the camera was well used and 1 year past the warranty but they didn't. The gentleman explained that by looking at the camera it was obvious it was not dropped or exposed to abuse and because it was a computer issue they would extend this courtesy. THANKS Canon,  I am a LOYAL customer for life.  Makes me feel great about the over 10k investment in your product!  Nice to see a big corporate company look out for their customers.Since the original purchase 2 years ago I have purchased a 2nd 5D, and 6 prime lenses. I was curious if this would be a passing phase but it was not.  I have gotten a lot of pleasure from this camera and continue to do so.The Canon Mark ll 5D is EXCEPTIONAL, anyone who says the 21.1 MP is overkill is underestimating the ability of cropping wildlife photos to the smallest part taken at a far distance.  I can still find sharpness in the smallest possible section of the focused part of a photo. It really is incredible; the vivid monitor's sharpness tells the whole story without dumping the large files onto a laptop. The edge of a ruffled bird's feather, the sunlight on the corner of a leave is still noticeable and sharp with 21.1 MP. Because you can ""double check"" the sharpness prior to snapping the photo using the LCD, you are saving yourself lots of editing (and space, the files are huge) on the computer. This instantly makes you a better photographer and frees up more time taking pictures instead of editing them. Also, if you manage to take fewer photos but better ones, this can make the extra space for these larger 21.1 MP pics (about 28mb)  on your computer's hard drive about a draw.I used for the first time a 100-400 IS lens and after 10 minutes of practice have taken better photos than ever before. The 180 Macro lens takes pictures like a microscope capturing the infinite details of nature hidden from the human eye. Adding the 21.1 MP factor makes your possibilities practically unlimited. If you do not use L series lenses or better, and do not have the budget for these lenses, wait and do not buy this... you will only be torturing yourself by not having them, they are a must have. It would be like driving a Ferrari on rims.Because the AF (auto focus) mode adjusts so many functions including the ISO, an amateur like me can enjoy taking photos while not being concerned about the settings I promised myself I would learn. I just can't put the camera down long enough to read up on it! As promised this camera is excellent in very low light with the noise factor eliminated or greatly reduced. Amazing the way the 5D picks up light at night, just amazing. Once you take pictures at night with this camera, no other camera will do.Also, for anyone wanting to learn more about this camera, (and really any other camera like it) Youtube ""Canon Mark ll 5D"" and you will find about 20 knowledgeable videos of pros doing hands on demonstrations, comparing similar models, and offering priceless tips about functions you never knew the camera had. This, along with Amazon's testimonials proved invaluable in my decision to buy. If you would like to see the manual ahead of time visit Canons website [...]I was initially concerned that the camera may be a little complicated since I moved directly to this higher end camera after using the smaller Canon SD cameras and snapping pics with my friends Rebel 300d. The 5D is quite simple and once you use it, you will be hooked.I also recommend a Hyperdrive, a hand held device up to 160 GIG (about twice as heavy as an iphone and a little thicker) that you can quickly dump the photos from a memory card onto. This will save you money on buying multiple memory cards and lugging around a heavy laptop on weekend trips, after all you can use the freed up space and less weight in your backpack for more lenses.Battery life is impressive and it seems you can do over 900 pics on one charge with LCD and probably 2 or 3 times as much without it.I tried to talk myself into a lower cost camera with less mega pixels. I wanted to say I would get a regular HD video camera that had more performance features later. I relented and ponied up for the 5D and realized that for me personally it was worth the extra bucks. Very nice LCD screen and HD video in one unit. Hopefully this will delay my desire for a better camera and after seeing the impressive resale value of used L series lenses, surprisingly close to cost of new (I bought all used Lenses on Craigslist that look new) and the cameras, I felt the investment would offer future returns I could not pass up.

I wanted something that I could view remotely from my desktop at work and my iPhone4.  I had done quite a bit of searching around for a solid IP camera before I settled on this.  I had looked at d-link, tenvis, wanscam, and others.  However, none of those had the number of views that Foscam had or the number of helpful setup tips.  Soo after long deliberation I decided this was reasonable to get even after I had some concerns related to reviews and security.  To break it down further -What I like:+Price+Size of the camera (It is not an extremely large camera by any means.  Good to keep ""hidden"" in a tight location)+IR cut (Adds a more realistic color.  Not washed out.  Take a look at AwkwardHamster's youtube video comparing other foscam models)+Accessing the camera remotely (It's good once you get pass the setup portion, which I explain in my comments)+Picture quality - Good (Don't expect it to be the sharpest quality.  You are not going to see a hair on the ground 5 feet away.  If you are expecting long distance use with this camera don't expect amazing quality images)+Wide variety of settingsWhat I didn't like:-Power cord (~3ft, who does that?)-Reviews, a bit off topic but I want to make a comment about all of them.  Now I didn't like that so many reviews on Amazon start off by saying ""I couldn't get my camera to connect so I contacted 'insert name here' from Foscam.  They connected the cameras in no time and were extremely helpful'.  At the time of this review 703 similar statements.  Now I find this somewhat fishy that 703 comments are similar.  It seems to me that it is a modified template for comments.  I can't say whether these statements are true or not but just keep it in mind that some if not all may be false comments.  Just my 2 cents.-Minimal information on remote DNS providers.  DNS provider - used to access camera outside of your home network.-Security encryption.  From what I have read in other comments this camera has no security when you try and remotely access this camera.  If you attempt to access it remotely your username/password is sent in ""Plain Text"".  This means if you use public wifi your password can be ""sniffed"" out.  Now this might of concern to some and others it's no big deal.  So I suggest for some to do more research on how to access your camera securely.  I personally plan on setting up the camera for viewing through a VPN (virtual private network).  I haven't done it yet but the goal is to purchase a router that has VPN capability and install tomato or dd-wrt.Stuck between like/don't like:>Camera setup.  This is a tough one.  Many people say turn away from this camera unless you have a degree in computer science because it is almost impossible to setup.  This is not necessarily true if you find the right steps online.  I didn't follow the owners manual for the setup or use the CD the camera came with.  I followed one reviewers steps and I got the camera up and running in no time.Camera Setup:I followed ""R. Tickle's"" instructions from March 29, 2012 to set the camera up.  Here is what he used with slight modifications and explanations that may make it easier for some.1) Do NOT install the software on the CD.  The CD is used to try and find the camera.  On my first attempt to access my camera I did toss the CD in and install the software, but unfortunately I was left with a blank text box with no camera IP.  The manual said I should reinstall the software so I did.  That didn't work so I decided to find it using my router web login explained below.2) Connect the camera by Cat-5 wire to your router.  My camera came with a coiled up cat-5 cable.  You shouldn't have to go searching for one.3) Login to your router (via browser, for linksys it is 192.168.1.1) and find the IP address assigned to your camera.  This should be fairly easy to do especially if you have the Linksys smart router.  Navigate to your connected devices and copy the cameras IP address.4) Login to the camera at that IP address (via browser) and IMMEDIATELY turn OFF the DHCP.  Copy and Paste the IP address for the camera into a new blank tab and hit enter.  This should take you to the foscam page that shows activex, server push mode, and mobile phone.  If you use IE select activex, firefox/chrome use server push mode.  Selecting one of those will give you a pop-up for username/password.  The default username/password is : Username-admin, there is no password.  Once you get in you can navigate to ""Basic Network Settings""  and uncheck DHCP.5) Give your camera a fixed IP address on your network and fill in the subnet mask with what you normally use.  This step is pretty simple.  You can assign your camera an IP address.  I used the IP it was initially assigned except I changed the last three numbers xxx.xxx.x.151.  Next you want to fill in the subnet mask, which can be found in your router settings or I believe it mostly is 255.255.255.0 (per google search of course).  Enter in your gateway IP and DNS server IP (you will use the same IP address for both of these.  you can find this IP address from your router login page in maybe a ""local networks"" tab it should be the IP address of your router).  The last thing you can fill in is the HTTP port.  Select a four digit number such as ""5252"".  Remember this because it will be used to setup port forwarding.  Now hit SUBMIT and wait for the camera to reboot.  Now that you have your IP address for your camera nailed down you may wish to go into your router and assign the IP camera a static IP address.  This ensures another device will not accidentally take your foscam IP address.6) Fill in the SSID, encryption type, and share key used by your wireless network.  Hit SUBMIT, this will reboot the camera.  Now you you can unplug the camera from your router.  ***NOTE*** I have found that once you enable wireless on the camera it may take some time to actually connect to your wifi network.  So if you reboot your camera be patient (more than 1 minute patient).  Watch the camera for the green LED to have a steady and consistent blink.  Any hesitation in blinking means it has not connected yet.7) Re-login to the camera at the new fixed IP address to verify that everything's working and your settings have stayed.8) Login to your router and set a port-forwarding entry to map to the fixed IP address and HTTP port you gave your camera.  You will also have to enter in the device IP address, the one you just gave the camera.9) Now in order to access the camera remotely you will need a DDNS service.  Foscam now recommends ""no-ip"" for free DNS instead of dydns.  Do a google search for it.  Create an account.  Foscam has their own service free for 3 years but after that you will have to pony up some money.  No-ip is free but and has one downfall, every 30 days you will need to say you will keep the DNS assigned to you.  I haven't had the service for more than 30 days, but from what I have found online you receive an email and have to navigate to a link that is in the email.  I guess this is the price you pay for a free service.10) Go back to your camera settings.  Select DDNS Service Settings then Select third party DDNS drop down and find no-ip.  Enter your username and password.  This is the information you used on the no-ip site to create an account.  Finally you will want to enter in the ddns host.  This is what you set up to be your camera website/host.  Example:  mycamera01(dot)no-ip(dot)biz.  Sorry about the dots, trying to avoid having information blocked.  Now click SUBMIT and wait for the camera to reboot.11) Now try and access your camera using your new host.  You can try this from 3G/4G to make sure you can connect outside your home network.  Open browser tab and enter in all the host information.  Using my example: mycamera01(dot)no-ip(dot)biz:5252.  If you notice I entered  :5252  after the host name.  This is because we changed it earlier in step 5.12) You now should be able to connect remotely.  Since the hard part is done go and change your username and password to the camera if you haven't done that yet.I hope these steps help lower the frustration of setting up this camera.My final comment!!IP Camera APPS. I mentioned earlier that I had an iPhone and wanted to access the cameras for remote viewing.  After much searching I decided to download ""LiveCams Pro"" right now $3.99 in the appstore.  I selected it after seeing others recommend it and seeing all the cameras they support.  I may or may not want a different camera manufacturer such as d-link and the app supports them.  However, this is not the only app available, Foscam has an app (not free) that you can download.  From what I have found it works well but other than that I haven't had experience with it.I will update with my opinion of the camera as time goes on.  Feel free to check back in a few months.",How is the software?,[],[],[],[],[]

When it does die out you can conveniently charge it with the included usb cable that has an interchangeable plug. This interchangeable plug can be swapped out with 3 other plugs that come with it. The device itself tells you how much power it has by the four led lights on the front of the battery. The less lights the less battery power. According to the manuel of the battery it takes about 8 hours to fully charge this battery. That is not that bad for what it outputs!Although you may have never heard of the Anker brand I highly recommend it. Their customer service is great and they make great and affordable products.

They give a totally different sound then in-ears or closed design phones, but for what they are I would say they're good. I currently own six pairs of phones, from stock apple earbuds to Sennheiser HD 518s. Gave my Portapros a run on both my computer's sound card and mp3 player, using 256 kbps mp3s or better. The clarity is good and they're very lightweight. The folding design is simple but effective. The look is certainly retro and unique, although I didn't find it as comfortable as many have claimed. Earpads are *very* thin and made my ears sore after 30 minutes of listening, although this can be remedied to a point by adjusting the ""comfort zone"" feature (tightening the temple pads while loosening the ear pads). The cord seems to be an average thickness, but I wouldn't get too rough with these. The steel headband adjusts smoothly and easily, just watch out that the slider doesn't catch your hair. Despite the sore ears, the phones are very lightweight overall.Back to the sound: as you would expect, it's good for a portable phone, but hardly earth shattering. At flat EQ the clarity is good, although the highs can sometimes be harsh. Bass is weak as expected, even with EQ adjusted up. To be fair, a portable on-ear would have a tough time comparing to the bass of an in-ear with a good seal or a pair with larger drivers. No sound isolation offered if you're into that sort of thing. Cool 80s phones, though I've certainly owned better portable on-ears (Sony makes excellent phones in this category). Soundstage is very narrow and lacks body. A good value if you can get them for under thirty, otherwise I'd rather invest in a nicer pair of phones. If we're talking about value, they're a good buy compared to new stock apple buds. If you're trying to compare the sound quality of this product to serious headphones, there's really no comparison at all.Update: After 100 hours of burn-in time the sound has not been affected in any appreciable way. Highs are still harsh, and bass is still underwhelming.

The fist year I shot with a Canon Rebel T2i (AKA 550D)  The image quality was good on this camera but the speed was lacking.What I didn't realize until I got the 7D was how much the speed was lacking.  The T2i is a great camera in it's own right and for consumers it's very good.  When I bought it I thought, hey it has virtually the same sensor as the 7D this should be good enough.Well, I had no idea how much difference the 19 cross type AF points would make, or how much faster 8 FPS was.  My keeper rate went up immediately.  Now, I realize there are other features I could mention, like the  7D is able to control off camera flashes without the use of a 500 series flash,  but really the reason to buy this camera is speed.  This is Canon's best crop frame sensor camera body, hands down, nothing else comes close.  For my purposes the cropped sensor is an advantage as it multiplies my effective focal length by 1.6 and ISO performance is not terribly important as I'm shooting in daylight.  But, I've spoken with many other photogs that have the 5D mk2 and mk3 and when they shoot outdoor sports they still use their 7D, it's AF system is just faster, as is it's frame rate and the added low light capability of the 5D is moot at 2pm outside.  Further, I shoot this camera with the double battery Canon vertical grip.  It makes for a big camera.  This fits my hand very well and the whole system feels very rugged and sturdy.  Much more so than the plastic bodied rebel.  If you are to read my other reviews you may be sensing a theme here.  Value.  This body is no exception.It's expensive for the novice and relatively inexpensive relative to other pro bodies but it defintely earns it's xD (single digit D) Canon designation.  It is a true pro body and at $1700 it's still a great deal, just look at how much you have to spend to get a 6D, 5D, or god forbid a 1D, and the 1D series are the first bodies to start to compare in terms of AF performance as the other cameras are more wedding cameras.  For the money, you can't beat the Al Servo performance of this camera.  Of course if money was no object I'd have a 1Dx and all the big boy primes but for me money matters and for my money this camera delivers pro quality.  I'm only excited now to see what the 7D mk2 looks like when Canon decides to best this legendary Camera body.",How is it picture ?,['The image quality was good on this camera but the speed was lacking'],[130],[1],[0.6],[ True]

I received it a few days later. It was great timing because I was just getting ready to leave on a business trip. I rapidly removed it from the box.  My initial impression was great. Starting from the cool box to the wireless keyboard case. The case looks great. It feels very sturdy and nice looking.  It is little thicker than my old case (another great case from NewTrend Airbend 2.0 (NT510K)).Next, I had to charge the case to use it. I had only a few hours left before I left. Now the charging process is a little strange.  The manual says that the light indicator should be lighted in RED, but I never saw it. I waited and eventually the light turned BLUE  (maybe the RED indicator only shows when the battery is dead. I will have to post an update once the first charge is over).Then came it came to placing my iPad Air into the new case. I struggled a little. The case is very tight. It is harder to take it apart.  Putting it together was very easy once I figured out how to take it apart. Each of the important input places are protected by a small tab which fits perfectly and makes the iPad well protected.  The case comes with a screen protector which is nice (I already have my screen protector), but I figured it will provide a double protection.  Now I had everything ready for my trip.When I boarded my flight, I was finally ready to use it.  First I needed to open the case to the position that felt most comfortable. There is a release button in the on the side of the case that releases the extension arm.  I pulled it too far and it came apart.  It was no problem. Pressed the button and placed the extension arm to the right level.  Now, I was truly ready to use it, but before I use it I had to pair the wireless keyboard and my iPad Air (updated to the last iOS).  First, I could not figure out how to turn on the keyboard. I did not read the manual, but I eventually figured that I need to hold the on/off button for a few seconds to turn it on and off. Then I pressed the pairing button which connected easily to my iPad.  Used extensively the keyboard during my 10 hours flight. I wrote emails and made notes in preparations for my upcoming client meetings. The keyboard felt nice. It was not clunky and was a good size.  With my first Airbender 2.0, I had some problems with the keyboard freezing my iPad which this worked perfectly.  During my trip, the passenger next to me commented about the case too. He said it looks really nice.During the week and my flight back, the case was still working perfectly. So far, no problems. I took some pictures with iPhone 5s. These may not be the greatest pictures, but it will provide you with some sense of this great case.

I had heard that the new software (Cisco Cloud Connect) was very intuitive and easy to use, despite some early controversy about it.  By the way, many of the 1 star reviews are based on concerns about privacy that have been put to rest by the manufacturer.This router is among a select few ""state of the art"" routers offering multiple but simultaneous operation on both the 2.4 and 5.0GHz bands - each band is capable of 3 streams (connections). This is a so called 900 router (the current gold standard for home routers).Much has been written about the new software - some of which was full of praise (including a glowing CNET review) and some of which is quite damning (including many 1 star reviews here on Amazon). The bottom line is that this software is wonderfully easy to use and any concerns that Cisco might be monitoring your internet activity have been put to rest by the manufacturer. Cisco has revised and clarified their policies to make it abundantly clear that this is a NON ISSUE. See Cisco's remarks posted right here on Amazon. So many of these 1 star reviews are quite dated.Also remember that Cisco allows you to opt out of this software altogether and administer your router locally with no connection to Cisco or the cloud (internet).What we have here is a ""top of the line"" advanced router that is very easy to set up thanks to its intuitive software.  That is exactly what I wanted ---- because routers can be quite difficult to setup/manage, particularly the very best (and most advanced) ones. The EA 4500 is very easy to setup and is a true ""set and forget"" type of device.So, what is not to like? The software and router are great and the fact that it can be managed in the cloud (meaning the router can be accessed via the internet) is largely unimportant. You will, most likely, just like me, simply set it up (using all or most of the simple software defaults) and forget about it! But for those of you who have the rare need to manage a router once it is set up , then you can access your router via any internet connection if you have passed Cisco's extensive security measures.As of August, 2012, the other competing routers you should look at are the Asus RT-N66U, WD (Western Digital) N900 and the Netgear R6300. I based my choice on Cisco's very intuitive software and very good range. While it may not always be the best (according to professional reviews), it has a better than average range.What may confuse many future buyers is that there is a new DRAFT (meaning far from finished) standard that is coming to Wi-Fi and routers. You will see, no doubt, many new routers coming to market boosting of conformance to the ""draft"" or the unfinished AC standard (802.11ac). The fact that NO clients (meaning there is NOT ONE real world receiving device) that exists for this new and yet to be finished standard is never pointed out. While meaningless, every router manufacturer will start to bring out new devices, or firmware upgrades to claim  ""compliance"" to this new DRAFT standard of AC. You can, at least for the next couple of years, largely ignore this spec.If you want a high performance router that simultaneously operates on both bands, can easily handle 3 simultaneous signals per band and works with all current standards and devices - then this is the one for you. If you want a set and forget type of device that is easy to setup ---this is also the one for you. Highly recommended.I should add this router also creates a GUEST network (a network that can never access your home files).Yet, if friends come over, they will be greeted with an easy Wi-Fi connection. You can turn off this feature easily in the setup but it is a real convenience that most people will like.  Frankly, I doubt there will be many that turn it off since it is both secure and really convenient for guests. Yet to be fair, most other new high end routers now also offer this same feature. So it is not unique to this router yet a welcome addition to the feature set of most newer high end routers.I'm hesitant to give performance figures. What I can say is that I have a large home. This router is located on the second story of my home, in the north most corner. I routinely connect on the first floor, on the south most corner, with excellent results. By accident, I had created a worse case scenario - yet I get top-notch results. There may be even better performing routers available but I'll take the easy set-up of this one versus all comers.I guess you could say I am happy with my purchase.",Does the software available?,[],[],[],[],[]

The tablets I've owned that I could compare this one to included theHP TouchPad Wi-Fi 32 GB 9.7-Inch Tablet Computer, the original Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1,Apple iPad MD366LL/A (16GB, Wi-Fi + AT&T; 4G, Black) 3rd Generation,ASUS Transformer TF300 T-B1-BL 10.1-Inch 32 GB Tablet (Blue)(with matching dock), the aforementioned Nexus 7,Google Nexus 10 (Wi-Fi only, 16 GB), and myMicrosoft Surface (32GB).  The Nexus 7 has turned out to be a worthy addition to this collection.  Here's why.PROS+ Lightweight build.  Last year's Nexus 7 was hardly a slouch in this department, and was more than portable enough for most.  The iPad Mini (which I purchased as a gift) is slightly thinner, but it doesn't really make any drastic improvements.  This device is markedly lighter than both, which makes it surprisingly easier in the hands.  You wouldn't think there was much room for improvement here (given the first generation was quite nice), but ASUS managed to pull it off.+ Great, understated looks.  Sure, the top and bottom bezels are a little larger, but compared to last year's Nexus 7, this device has a lot more ""class"" to it.  The exterior bezels now lack the bright silver banding, which helps the screen melt away into the bezels.  That's all the better, since as an LCD panel (which won't achieve the same black-levels as a AMOLED display from Samsung) is the centerpiece of this device, it's best to keep your focus on it.  The back is nice and smooth, with the word ""NEXUS"" inscribed into the back.  The branding is non-obtrusive and otherwise non-existent on a device that all around has a sophisticated, matte look to it.+ Powerful performance.  Without getting into too much technical information, the processor in this device (a rebranded Qualcomm Snapdragon 600) is significantly more powerful than the Nexus 7's Tegra 3 in every way.  It's also more power efficient, so you can watch your movies and games for longer, all while enjoying stunning looks.  Which brings me to the next two points...+ Beautiful screen.  This is a Full HD (1080p) panel in a 7"" package.  The best effort prior to this was Amazon's own Kindle Fire HD 8.9, which had a 1080p panel as well.  At present, this device has the sharpest screen (in terms of PPI) of any device, even compared against Apple's iPad 3 and Samsung's Nexus 10.  Colors are sharp and vivid and the screen has no motion blurring or ghosting.  My unit also doesn't have any light bleed, although I've seen some people complaining about it.+ Better hardware for longevity.  You may have heard of the recent kerfuffles around last year's Nexus 7, which has started to slow down and lag for many users.  The problem lay in how the device managed its onboard storage-- which, to put it mildly, was poor.  If you didn't mind tinkering and rooting your device, you could fix the issue, but that should never be a requirement in a consumer product.  Luckily enough, the refresh's hardware boasts better memory and Android 4.3 will automatically keep things in good shape, so you won't have to worry about this.+ Sound is pretty good for a small device.  It gets plenty loud without much distortion.  Unfortunately, ASUS elected to keep the speakers on the back for some unknown reason (especially with nice bezels on the top and bottom that could have provided stereo in landscape-- which is where you'd need those speakers most).  This is especially perplexing considering how well-reviewed the speakers on the Nexus 10 and HTC One were-- both packed front-facing stereo speakers.+ Android 4.3 under the hood means you've got a faster, more secure mobile experience than any previous version.  Even if you're primarily an iOS user, the Nexus 7 is definitely worth a look.  The Play Store's got almost all the heavy hitters you'd use on a tablet (such as Amazon Kindle, Netflix, a YouTube experience second to none, and the full power of Google's own services as an example), as well as some amazing Android-exclusive apps (such as Press, a beautiful RSS reader for those who prefer to take their news this way).  Many people have griped in the past about Android and tablet apps, but...+ You'll also find a mature and solid ecosystem waiting for you.  As a 7"" device, the refreshed Nexus 7 sits between traditional 10""-class tablets and the smartphone, meaning it can use apps designed for either very well.  Although most Android apps are still designed for phones, they scale up very well on the Nexus 7 (nothing like Apple's frankly laughable 2x zoom mode available on the iPad/iPad Mini).  Android tablet apps are also getting better by the day, so unless there really is that one killer app you can't leave behind, give it a whirl!+ Android 4.3 also provides multiuser support, so if you have this tablet in any social settings (having friends over, throwing a party, and so on), you can easily set up a guest profile for friends to use while keeping your own stuff under lock and key.  It's also great as a family tablet-- share the device among multiple members while keeping everyone's stuff separate.  Things have also gotten a lot faster since the 4.2 days, so if you had any issues before, give it another go.+ Notification light!  Hoorah!  Long-time Android users will instantly recognize how useful these things are, and as a casual device to leave lying around your desk, the light makes things much better.  Let's say you're walking by a coffee table and you receive an e-mail.  With an iOS device, the screen will light up for a few seconds, and a pulsing icon will let you know that you've got a message of some sort.  And both iOS and Android handsets without a light (such as last year's Nexus 7) will beep or produce a tone to let you know the same.  But if you happen to walk by after those time out, you'd never know that you have something waiting for you.  With a notification light, you get a persistent, unobtrusive and instantly-visible way of seeing that something's waiting.+ Great battery life.  Although the battery's smaller than last year's Nexus 7 (probably to slim down the build), Android 4.3 and the newer Snapdragon processor make for quite a powerful (hehe) package that will run all day and then some without trouble.  I have yet to charge mine after receiving it two days back, and I'm still looking at 50% remaining after heavy use.Of course, this isn't all sunshine and daisies.  Make sure you're making an informed purchase.  Here are some cons I've noticed.CONS- The cameras are forgettable.  Good enough for video calling, but it won't even replace most smartphone cameras.- I'm having screen lift issues in the upper left hand-hand side of my tablet, which means the back creaks a little if I press on it.  It doesn't impact functionality at all, and hopefully it may go away after a while, but my launch-day 8GB Nexus 7 from last year also had this issue.  needless to say, I'm a little annoyed that they weren't more rigorous this time around.  Not something you should have to deal with as a consumer.- Top and bottom bezels make the device a little larger than it has to be.  Depending on how you use this device, it could actually be a major pro for you (as wider bezels give you a better surface to grip without accidentally touching the screen).  For me, it's a definite con, since I think it makes the device look a tad silly.- Slightly less grippy than last year's model.  The refresh loses the dimpled texture of the original, which makes it a little more ""slick"" in the hand.  It's not awful by any means, but do keep in mind that it can slide a little more on surface than you'd expect.- The buttons.  Are maddening.  They're basically flush with the chassis, and while there's solid feedback on all three (power, volume up, volume down), they're very close to one another and feel exactly the same.  Expect to hit volume up a lot trying to wake this device up.All in all, I'd say buy this one with confidence.  It's well worth the upgrade if you're on the fence, and if you're new to the Android tablet land, this is an amazing place to start.  As a Nexus device, it'll get long software support and fast upgrades, so you'll always be getting the latest and greatest.  Questions?

Jawbone will not pay for return shipping of a defective unit or provide a shipping label, believe it or not for such a pricey purchase, so I add another $10 to the $200 I already paid. So I only rate the Jambox as four stars because they have a quality control problem and a mean-spirited return policy for their stupid defective units.Now, happily with minimal effort as I already had the required software loaded, the tiny unit can play music streamed via Bluetooth from both my iPhone and iPad anywhere in my apartment without the unit being anywhere near them. As David Pogue said - ""Magic!"" AND it also acts as a cell phone answerer and speakerphone with built-in microphone. When the unit is on it will automatically silence the speakers on my iPhone or iPad and hold this stream if a phone call comes in at the same time. The sound quality is much better than I expected from a palm-sized 12oz gadget. I can walk around the house taking it from room to room as I do other things and listen at the same time to my music. I can watch videos and streaming movies on my iPhone or iPad with great big sound instead of tinny little sound from the mini-speakers in the devices. Somehow this big sound makes the videos seem much more compelling to watch. I can hear no buzzing, hissing or other wireless interference so the sound is completely clean to listen to classical music.Pressing a button on top of the unit brings a voice that tells you how much battery life is left. It is claimed to play for 10 hours before needing re-charge but I haven't yet tested this.I can imagine taking this with me on car journeys to listen to music on my iPhone and answer phone calls on the road with just the press of one button and no driving distraction. I also plan to take it with me on vacations to play in hotel or cruise ship rooms. The price is too high but what-the-hell for such convenience.",Is the unit very compact?,[],[],[],[],[]

The beauty of today's computing devices is that consumers are no longer forced to buy one-size-fits-all, and instead, have the choice to buy what best fits their needs. I've used the ASUS T100 (64GB) over the past couple of days, and while I wouldn't consider it powerful/comfortable enough as primary computing device, I think it makes great sense as a secondary machine, especially with the advances in cloud storage.From my perspective, the ASUS T100 is basically a tablet with the ability to become a mini-notebook. Whether you will love or hate it strongly depends on what your intended application and expectations are. I plan to use the ASUS T100 for both work and recreation, with note-taking, email, web browsing, presenting, and video playback being the most common tasks, and from my initial impression, it does these jobs quite well. While I found the keyboard a bit too cramped for my liking (smaller-than-normal keys + tighter spacing + my big hands = not very happy), and wasn't too keen on the touch/clickpad (doesn't always respond to the first touch, two-finger scrolling can be a bit jerky, loud and hollow-sounding click), it wasn't a deal-breaker considering the price point. The keyboard dock is really usable, and I appreciated having it when I was typing longer emails and editing office documents.The ASUS T100 features a Intel Atom Z3740 Quad-Core processor which is exceptionally power efficient and much better performing than previous Atoms, though it is still slow compared to traditional notebook/ultrabook processors. For example, the year-old ""low-end"" Pentium 2117U, rated at 17W TDP, is more than twice as fast as the Atom Z3470 in single-threaded workloads though it can also draw ~4X more power. The Z3740 is pretty even with the Pentium in multi-threaded workloads, through the slower single-threaded performance will be more evident with slower app/program launches, etc.At the end of the day, I like the ASUS T100. ASUS has developed many 2-in-1 transforming solutions in the past and its expertise shows in the T100 ~ while made of the plastic, the overall build quality and precision is good for the price. I more or less agree with the specifications such as as the CPU and 64GB of eMMC, though I think 2GB of RAM is too stingy, especially since it cannot be upgraded later. Overall, I think the ASUS Transformer Book T100 is a much needed breath of fresh air and I'm excited about the future possibilities.Notes:1) Compared to the ARM versions of Microsoft's Surface RT and upcoming Surface 2 (non-pro), the ASUS T100 offers an exceptional value proposition by bundling Office 2013 and being compatible with regular Windows software.2) For my own computing needs, I found the combination of a portable machine with good battery life, paired with a powerful desktop to be ideal. The ""good-enough"" performance of the ASUS T100 along with great battery life and ability to fall back to full-blown Windows makes it well suited for this role.3) Web Browsing and Document editing on Microsoft platforms is generally a great experience. Internet Explorer on both Modern and Desktop modes is fully functional and delivers a rich web experience with Flash, Javascript, HTML5, etc. Office 2013 allows for native viewing and editing of documents which is something iOS and Android sometimes have difficulty with.4) Office 2013 Home and Student is pre-installed and includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and One Note. A serial number for activation is in the box.5) The charging cable is Micro USB but is very short by laptop standards. It attaches to the tablet side instead of the keyboard dock. The USB port on the keyboard dock is on the LEFT side.6) The Windows 8.1 UI feels very fluid though App/Program launches can be sluggish.7) Free space on the 64GB version is ~ 37GB. Windows 8 has a built-in recovery mechanism which allows you to re-install/repair Windows or remove all user files.8) The T100 supports Microsoft's Connected Standby feature which means it only sips power in the suspend state so you don't need to turn it on/off frequently. Modern Apps such as email are refreshed periodically even in suspend so the live tiles are ""fresh"" when you resume the system. Resume from suspend is nearly instantaneous. It should be noted that desktop apps are suspended during Connected Standby so they are not refreshed.9) Boot times are quick ~ the system can boot to the start screen in &lt;10 seconds.10) A full-sized USB port on the tablet would have been highly appreciated...Hopefully a future version will have multiple USB ports!11) Slightly Annoying: The Windows button on the front/bottom of the tablet doesn't do anything! The only way to get back to the Start screen from the desktop is either to hit the Start Button or use the charms.12) Battery life is really quite good. I haven't run it down from 100% to zero but 8 hours of light use is very doable.",How much is the amount of sony?,[],[],[],[],[]

It makes a world of difference in how much more air can flow through under the pad and up to your laptop. Also, beware of using this on top of a table cloth - it seems to impede air flow as well. With the legs propping up the cooling pad, my GPU temps only hit about 84-86 degrees, but without it propped up, my GPU is still 90-91 degrees.Overall, it's a small ~$20 investment to potentially increase the life of my laptop as a whole.",How does the fan work?,"['this cooler fits it just about perfectly'

The kit Lens that came with my camera is completely silent, and I have yet to hear any camera noise picked up hen shooting video, even in quiet, indoor shoots. I bought this lens for the same purpose, as well as shooting photos, as it is a great focal length for video, and the low aperture is great for low-light photos. Here are my conclusions:For Photos: This lens is incredible. The pictures are razor sharp, and when you shoot with the aperture wide open, the bokeh effect you can achieve is really cool and makes for some beautiful, intriguing photos. The autofocus is quick and responsive, allowing you to quickly frame and shoot. The only downside to this lens is since there is no Image Stabilization, you have to be very steady when shooting hand-held, especially if you get below 1/100th shutter. Adjusting the settings, you can usually find a clear shot, it just may take some toying. On a tripod, you have nothing to worry about, obviously. This was definitely a good purchase for photos.For Videos: The quality of video produced by this lens is great. It lets in some serious light with the f/2.8 aperture, so you can do some good low-light shoots. The focal length is ideal for most video applications, but the lack of zoom does make for some walking around to frame the shot properly. The downside with this lens when compared to the STM 18-55mm is that the autofocus motor makes some noise. I was used to complete silence with STM lenses, and this one, although quiet, can still be picked up, especially when shooting with the internal mic. It's nothing compared to a non-stm lens, which are much louder, but it is audible and can be picked up in quiet shoots. Not a huge deal, but it is worth noting, if this lens is being purchased with that function in mind. If you are using any kind of external micing, you should be fine.Pros:Crisp, good color, fast autofocus, solid construction, light-weight, small form factorCons:Autofocus a little noisy",How is the quality of the autofocus?,"['as the STM lenses have almost completely silent autofocus'

It did take a little time to get used to - I found I was unconsciously 'hunching forward' a bit when first wearing it, but it is by no means uncomfortable...just different.  The way the cords are attached with a movable loop, and the provided rubber earpiece covers in different sizes should provide sufficient sizing  options for most users.  I'm fairly bull-necked and I don't feel the cords 'pulling' the earbuds from my ears at all, even when turning my head.The battery took a fair amount of time to take an initial full charge, but after that it seems to last quite a while.  Even after playing a game on my Surface for a 3 hr planeflight, it still said &#34;battery high&#34; the next time I turned it on.  There's a small lighted indicator for the battery charging that goes from red to blue when it hits full.Verbal feedback is great.  &#34;Connected....battery high&#34;.  Audio feedback with beeps of ascending or descending scale when changing volume level.  The buttons are findable with your fingers only when wearing to raise/lower volume, and presumably the answer call button although I'm not using as a phone function.Sound is fairly good - I don't really notice much background hiss, and both music and game audio seems full range.  I actually find I have to have these set at near minimum volume to be comfortable with it, even in high ambient noise situations (airplane), so it's got plenty of oomph.If I have any complaints at all, I wish it had a little more visible &#34;left&#34; and &#34;right&#34; indications, vs. the rather tiny molded letters in a box.  I guess in time I'll get used to the fact that I want the volume up/down buttons on the left side.  Then again, the volume plus or minus indicator vs. the track up track down indicators molded into the buttons are also very small, and don't provide any tactile distinction between them, so its not easy to tell whether you've put them on backwards.  That's one reason for a one star deduction.  The other reason for a slight deduction is I do wish the magnets that hold the ear buds in place when not inserted in the ear were a little stronger, like other reviewers have commented.  They do stay in place when the device is just cuffed around your neck, but tend to wander when tossed in a pocket of my computer or camera bag, so I'm always sort of semi-untangling them (and then squinting at them to figure out left vs right) before I can put them on.Sound does get a little choppy when using this on a Surface with a Bluetooth mouse also enabled.  But that may be the Surface's fault in terms of the available stack bandwidth and prioritization.  Not taking a star off for that.Supplied USB cord for charging is fine.  I don't have any complaints about range since I use them while at the laptop (Surface) not wandering around a football field and expecting them to still connect.Overall quite pleased.  Good sound isolation from background, plenty of volume, audio range is acceptable for music (not audiophile quality by any means - what wireless headphones are? - and besides I'm 40+ so my hearing itself is probably damaged at the high end).  Perfect companions for a lightweight laptop or tablet with Bluetooth.  Just need a little more visual indication and/or tactile differentiation between left and right side buttons (simplest idea but not everyone would like it - just make the whole right side of red plastic and the left side of white or black plastic...).

Mouse feels great. I might have appreciated a rubberized feel to the sides of this mouse rather than the textured hard plastic, but it's just as effective.This mouse lost a star due to a couple annoyances I have.First off, this does not use the Logitech universal receiver that the company uses for other wireless keyboards/mice. It's receiver polls at a much higher frequency. This paired with the fact that the mouse runs off of one AA NiMH battery, means the battery life is pretty abysmal; few hours at most. They've cleverly designed the charging cable to turn the mouse into a cabled variant which is convenient, but I now find myself almost exclusively using the mouse in this way rather than via wireless which defeats the purpose.Secondly, I lift my mouse off the mat while using it quite often. It's a habit I've had for 15 years or so. When I do that with this mouse, I almost always push one or two of the bottom thumb buttons. It's been enough of a problem that I've had to manually set these buttons to do nothing in games and the Logitech software (it would affect the DPI of the mouse).

Sharp, detailed, good dynamic range. There are two issues I have with this camera, however. First off, it has a tendency to overexpose and clip highlights. Secondly, while it keeps noise at bay through ISO1600, it seems to do this through very aggressive noise reduction at ISO800 and beyond, taking a toll on fine detail. The Olympus XZ-2 on the other hand, has more noise at ISO800 but also more detail. Personally, I like cameras that retain fine detail better and don't mind a little noise. But to say that the RX100 is an open and shut case as far as IQ is concerned (when compared to its competitors)...not quite.I am not particularly thrilled about the F4.9 at the telephoto end but the lens has nice characteristics otherwise so I really don't see that as a negative overall. What is a negative overall is how long it takes for the lens to zoom in and out and it's loud when it does it.The autofocus performance on this camera is somewhat disappointing in low-light. It's fine in the daytime but in low-light it's almost as slow as the much less-expensive Powershot S100. Also I had issues with the image stabilization is not great on the camera for some reason. I found in a lot of instances that you had to hold onto the camera very tightly in order to get a blur-free shot. I think that is inexcusable for a $650 camera.Some people have commented on the battery life of this camera. It's not the greatest but that's one of the trade-offs you have to make with a small pocket camera. Your best bet is just to get an extra battery.The LCD screen on back is very nice being somewhat viewable in direct sunlight. The menu system on the camera is a very nice and more straight-forward than other Sony cameras that I've used. The dial up front doesn't have decisive clicks that the Powershot S100 has but it's still nice to have considering that some enthusiast cameras don't have it at all.Ergonomics-wise, I think this camera could use some improvement. The shiny metal body is slippery up front and could benefit from some sort of grip or textured surface to make the camera more secure in your hand.Video generally looks nice, I haven't tested it much. But it generally is sharp and the audio sounds good.I think the RX100 was a respectable first compact enthusiast camera for Sony. And indeed, it's remarkable they were able to take a relatively large sensor and put it in such a compact light-weight camera. It's image quality is a cut above any enthusiast compact out there. But it has some performance-related issues that need refinement. Not terrible, but it could have been better on a $650 camera. Overall though, a great first enthusiast compact from Sony.",What was the best result?,['Image quality at lower ISOs is excellent'],[160],[1],[1.],[ True]

Overall, it appears to be a good case, though I have a number of quibbles with it. I have had the case only a few days, so these are initial impressions.Good stuff: The case fits the iPad 3 very well. It is a bit snug, perhaps; I have seen some reviewers complain about this, but I consider it to be an advantage. The auto-on-off switch, activated by a magnet when the case is closed, works just fine. My primary concern was that the case would hold the iPad securely, without slipping, especially when being used as a stand in the upright position. The case I bought for my original iPad failed in this regard. The new case, however, uses a velcro closure that feels very secure. It does not slide around in the case at all.Neutral stuff: The buttons on the side of the unit are not easy to reach, but that is more a function of the design of the iPad rather than the case. Exposing the buttons would require exposing more of the iPad, which would not be a good design decision (IMO). Be advised that while the product literature suggests that this case is made of leather, it isn't. I knew that when I purchased it, so that wasn't an issue for me. However, if anyone is led to believe that this is a leather case, be assured: it isn't. The case features a hand strap on the back of the flap, for use when the flap is folded around. I have not found a good way to use this flap, so I consider it a neutral feature. (YMMV) Finally, I have not used the stylus loop, and I don't plan to, so I have nothing to say in that regard (except that it successfully stays out of the way if you don't care to use it).Bad stuff: This case is heavy. I was surprised at how heavy it is. With the case, it gives up any gains in weight that it had over the original iPad; in fact, I believe the iPad 3 with this case weighs more than my iPad 1 in its case. This is only an issue when I am supporting the iPad in my hands, but it is noticeable at those times--and annoying. Also, this case smells. It has a chemical, fake-leather smell that is unpleasant and sticks to your hands. I expect that the smell will fade over time (I have used fake leather steering wheel covers in my car, and they have the same problem), but for now, it's yet another annoyance. Finally--and this is little more than a quibble--the angles at which the iPad sits when the case is used as a stand are not quite to my liking. The angle in the upright position is too steep, and the angle in the leaned-back position is too shallow.Summary: I gave this case four stars, and I would recommend it to a friend. Of course, I would inform him of the disadvantages that I have noted in the review. However, they do not outweigh the advantages of the case (again, IMO).",How do you like the texture?,[],[],[],[],[]

The issues did not happen straight away. On the second day of shooting  is when the trouble started.  I make no claim to be a professional photographer, this review is an opinion of a photo hobbyist. So after shooting around a 180 pictures mostly with the view finder the camera went dead no power to the unit. I also had an error code display, I can't  say  for sure  that I could see the entire code, but the camera stopped working. When this happened I removed the battery, and placed it back in the camera, and then the camera powered on. It  performed flawlessly for about 20 or more shots. The shots I took looked amazing but I also had some bad shots. I will take credit for the bad shots  it was not the fault of the camera. When I was finished shooting,  I removed the camera battery and placed it in the charger. The very next day I went for a photo shoot. I shoot mostly view finder,I shot about 200 photos this time. When I was finished shooting  I turned the camera off. Sometime later I went to use the camera  again, I turned the camera on, and no responded. I removed the battery, and charged it, when it was fully charged I placed the battery in the camera and  it worked just fine. I have not used the camera since. I'm concerned with the camera , I bought the camera to use on a family vacation. I don't want to have my camera fail on my vacation, so the following morning I called Amazon Customer Service. I explain my situation with the camera. Amazon is sending me a new camera, expedited shipping it will be here on Wednesday. I will rate this camera with 4 stars.  I will subtract one star for being  unreliable, I really love this camera , and hope the next one will be problem free. I could have just received a lemon I understand  that. Would I recommend this camera to someone else despite its shortcomings.  The answer is yes, however  my tune my change if  I receive another unit with the same issues. Well if that happens I will cut my loses and get a refund sad to say. I owned many Canon cameras both film, and digital and all of those examples performed flawlessly. Until then I will wait with anticipation  for the  new unit to arrive. I rate 5 stars to Amazons customer service they always shine in my eyes.

It is also sharp, acceptably-so wide open, and razor sharp stopped down a bit. Nice bokeh. Combine this with a D700 or D3 and you have perhaps an incomparable low combo!

SharpKeys is a quick-and-easy solution for Windoze 2000/XP/7/8.  Make sure you download it from the author's website as the first two installers I downloaded (from sites I had considered trustworthy) were full of bloatware.  Once installed, I swapped the mapping of the up-arrow and right shift keys on my K400 and wow what a difference.  I'm actually pretty happy with this keyboard after this fix.  I would increase the rating to 4 stars, but the credit goes to randyrants_dot_com for the software, not Logitech.  The only downside with this fix is that it swaps the keys in the OS, so if you plug in another keyboard the up-arrow and right shift will be swapped on that too.  And if you VNC or Remote Desktop you will likely experience the same problem there.The only unfortunate thing with this finding is that there are so many reviews of this keyboard it's not likely that many existing owners will see this fix.Original Review:The K400 is a decent wireless keyboard.  The layout is pretty good given the small format.  The tactile feedback is good.  The battery life, so far, has been pretty good.  I've only had the keyboard for 2 months but just discovered the on/off switch, so I'm fairly impressed the battery has lasted this long (although it may also have an auto-off power save feature).  The range is just okay.  The spec indicates > 30', but my couch is just 10' from my PC in my media center and if I'm reclined or have my legs up a bit it tends to block the transmission.  If I have the media cabinet door closed the range is only a few feet at best.Despite these few short comings, this would be a nearly 5-star product save the one fatal flaw -- the location of the right shift key.  If you look at the right shift key on any well-used keyboard you'll generally see a shiny spot on the left side - where most people strike the key.  Logitech, a company which typically puts out some good, smart products, blew this one.  They put the up-arrow key in this location, making a skinny little shift key to the left of the up-arrow.  After two months of use I still up-arrow virtually every time I try to use the left shift key.  It drives me nuts and and is the reason for the 2-star review.  I have no earthly idea what they were thinking, I can only assume they never actually tested it.",Is it a wireless keyboard?,[],[],[],[],[]

In fact, once while playing NFS: Hot Pursuit (The newest one) the laptop actually went into thermal protection because the CPU crossed 100 degrees (Celsius).On idle, without the fans, it holds steady between 55 and 60 degrees.With fans I'm usually between 38 and 46.So we can easily say this is more than a 20% decrease in heat. And as we know with electronics, the cooler it is, the more efficient it works.I placed one fan directly under the CPU and the other under the RAM.These fans are extremely quiet, so you'll actually forget that they're on!I also disagree with the person that stated that this item cannot be used on one's lap due to the open back design. The fans come covered. And even then, the pad is at an angle so they don't even touch my legs if I'm on the bed. Also, if it's hot, using the laptop on your lap actually helps to keep your legs a bit cooler as well!Be very careful with the fans as you dismount and remount as the clips that hold them in place do seem to be rather cheaply made and will probably break very easily.Also, be gentle with the USB power plug. It also seems to be cheaply made and may break with too rough a use.All in all I have already recommended this product to a friend and would suggest it to anyone whose laptop gets to hot to stay on your leg.I also recommend this highly over the other coolers that have one big central fan. The fact that these fans are removable, you can position them exactly where the problem is.One big central fan with a fancy blue light is pretty... but this one is just purely efficient!Since I've had this item, the hottest I've been able to achieve was 83 degrees.

Aesthetically speaking, it's nice enough, with a slate-colored matte finish and a smooth feel that is not polished or slick, so that it will not inadvertently escape your grasp.I generally don't like any case (with or without a keyboard) that is intended to be used essentially as a permanent home for the ipad because the form factor and tactile experience of a naked ipad is so nice and enjoyable that it usually cheapens the experience when it's in a protective case. (For instance, the Otterbox cases cases certainly offer good protection, but it's such a chore to get the ipad secured into it in the first place that you never want to take it out --- so i actually got rid of my eexpensive Otterbox case.) The ipad snaps very easily and quickly in and out of place in the Airbender case, however. Even better, you can simply detach the iPad enclosure from the keyboard portion of the case and hold the iPad normally. This makes it easy to envision using the case on days when one is going to do a lot of typing, such as note-taking in meetings, but popping the case off when you want to sit with the ipad on your lap in the evening for some casual web browsing, facebook, or watching a movie, etc.Overall, I find this to be a nice product that is very competitively priced.PROS:- The keyboard responds well, connection via bluetooth is easy and fast, the battery life is on par with other similar products, and the fact that it allows for rotating the iPad to portrait mode is a nice plus.- It's great that you can utilize this case in so many different positions, with the iPad and keyboard each attached or detached, in portrait or landscape mode, etc.- Lightweight, and does not add a lot of additional bulk to the iPad.CONS:- My biggest complaint with this case is that I found the placement of the ""lock"" button on the small keyboard, just above the ""delete"" button to be a bit of a flaw. Far too often, when I tried to correct a misspelled word by using the delete button I mistakenly hit the lock button, and then had to stop typing, and unlock the ipad using the slider on the screen. Like all keyboard cases, it's a product best used by someone with hands small enough to successfully type on a compact keyboard.",How about case?,['is a remarkably lightweight keyboard case' 'is so nice and enjoyable'],[ 30 556],[1 1],[0.75 0.75],[ True  True]

Doesn't matter if it's PC or console, it's something I enjoy. The one thing I never really felt at home with, however, were mice. Unfortunately, I could never find a mouse that really felt 'right', or didn't hurt my hand after prolonged use. The mousing 'motion' is just not something that, well, meshes with me. I've been through dozens of Logitech and Razer mice, and eventually gave up. I knew what I wanted - Thumb control, like playing with a controller. I eventually found myself looking into a trackball, and settled on the old ""red ball"" trackman wheel.The Trackman Wheel, unfortunately, had a few issues. I didn't mind that it was wired. I did, however, find myself frustrated with the lack of forward and back buttons. Second of all, the optical DPI was just way too low for precise aiming in FPS games. If I remember correctly someone rated it at 400dpi, which is just unacceptable. A solid trackball, but these two little errors sent me slinking back to my trusty Razer Lachesis.I actually wrote Logitech an email describing a ""gaming trackball"" with laser tracking. I highly doubt they ever read my email, but they actually released the exact product I wished for, so I jumped right on it!Unfortunately, I have yet to get an invite to the Vine program, so I actually had to dish out the 49.99 myself. I don't regret it!First of all, the wireless technology in this trackball is certainly up to date. Latency is not an issue at all, and having the option to be wireless is certainly a plus. I do wish it came with a detachable cable in case you didn't want to deal with the battery, but then again, the single AA battery this unit requires promises to last up to 18 months. If this is true then I cannot mark this product down. I've had it for two weeks now, and so far, so good. I am running Windows 7.The addition of back and forward buttons answers the plea that many people have been crying for ever since the old Microsoft Trackball Optical was discontinued: A fully featured thumb-controlled trackball that doesn't cost 400 dollars due to becoming a collectors item.To make things better, most people always agreed that the Trackman series had better ergonomics than the MS Trackball, however the lack of buttons was the big deal breaker. It seems that most companies focus on their palm/prominent fingered trackballs and totally ignore the thumb-based ones.The M570 is the answer to all these problems, well, and more.I was quite shocked and excited when I heard that it was using a laser sensor. I am unsure of the DPI since Logitech doesn't seem to release that information, but it's certainly much higher than the Trackman Wheel, which makes it a godsend. The accuracy is top notch, the glide of the ball is just right, and the buttons feel solid. Nevermind the comfort of the ball in general. There are no problems there. I really cannot find anything wrong with this ball.If I was going to add anything it would be the following: Actual published DPI rating, Additional buttons for on-the-fly DPI adjustment, and finally one of those awesome Hyperscroll wheels that Logitech has released on their gaming mice.It seems that Logitech is even downplaying the fact that this ball is laser-tracked. The question is: Why? I know I am not the only person who games with a trackball, and while many people have settled with Kensington's balls for the task, I have been waiting out for an appropriate thumb-controlled trackball. Perhaps the M570 is just a test before they release the true ""gaming grade"" trackball? Or will this be the final hurrah in the trackball world?As of writing this, the M570 is undoubtedly the best Trackball on the market, not only for gaming but also casual use. Despite the few features that could have been included, the addition of laser tracking and two control buttons make it tough to beat and fills a huge void in the market. One can only hope this device's success convinces Logitech to continue further with their trackball efforts. Until then, the M570 will be my ball of choice for headshots.",What do you think about each button?,"[""The Trackman Wheel, unfortunately, had a few issues. I didn't mind that it was wired. I did, however, find myself frustrated with the lack of forward and back buttons.""

Over the years since the first Kindle, I have purchased vast quantities of Kindle books. Currently, I own 5 Kindles (6 with the Fire HD). They are: the Kindle 1 (by far the best display of all the later e-ink kindles with an SD card slot and a user replaceable battery, which later editions omitted), returned a Kindle 2 for display issues, kept a Kindle 3 (Keyboard), own 2 Kindle touches, the original Fire, and now the Fire HD. All are used by my family. So when I ordered the KF-HD it was with high expectations of really wanting to love this thing. I use the original Fire all the time and love it. Here's what I found about the new Kindle Fire HD:Out of the box the hardware is impressive to say the least, and having used it extensively since receiving it, I find it this Kindle has too many problems to justify keeping the unit until they fix some MAJOR engineering mistakes and software inadequacies that are embarrassingly idiotic. The first Kindle Fire works great. This one, well, leaves much to be desired. Here are the Pros and Cons, as I have experienced them:Pros:1. Fantastic sound with the Dolby turned on. If this feature is off, the speakers sound worse than the original Kindle Fire. You can get this same sound on the original Kindle Fire using good external speakers or a good set of headphones.2. Whispersync with Voice (concurrent with a very big con, see below).3. Text to Speech.4. Very crisp and clear display (with a concurrent con, see below).Cons:1. The HD video display when viewing videos is either slightly on the orange to green side for skin tones (as compared to the original KF). The original Kindle Fire had much more realistic flesh tones on videos. All videos, at least in my opinion.2. The power cable attaches to the side of the unit, rather than at the top or bottom, making it impossible to charge and watch or read anything in landscape mode while charging. This is a major inconvenience. Given a choice between an HDMI cable output and a charging indicator, give me a charging indicator and let the Cloud do its job so it's unnecessary to plug in the Fire to a TV.3. No charging indicator light. How basic is this?? All other Kindle's have indicator lights! Was this an oversight? Or,engineering stupidity at it's best...you decide.4. Power switch and volume control are flush with the casing, impossible to see and/or find in the dark-unless you turn the unit on its side and push til you find a switch.5. Consistently has problems connecting with a wireless connection, giving the error of ""authentication failure"", making it necessary to connect using the ""Settings, Wireless, Connect"" from the settings menu (works fine after that).6. Whispersync for Voice and Audible.com do not communicate well at all! I bought several books (free) with free associated audio books from audible.com. What a nightmare! Audible.com does not automatically link your Amazon account, and when it does, it picks the first 3 devices to use on your account there. If the first 3 do not list your kindle fire HD, you cannot download the books wirelessly to your device from Amazon's Manage Your Kindle page or Audible.com's My Library page. Further, unless you deregister your device and then re-register it, you cannot change the order of the availability of your devices. However, when you do download the book and follow the link for ""professional narration"", it will link in for a purchase. You must then open your book in the Kindle Fire HD, and touch the bottom of the screen on the Chapter 1 page (beginning of book) for it to first download a sample audio, and then the purchased audio from Audible.com. MAJOR HASSLE. Without seamless integration of these two services, Kindle books and Audible.com, it becomes a big frustration very quickly. Did I mention that Audible.com charges $14.95 PER MONTH for membership? Not user friendly in a recession/depression environment! How about a ""no strings attached"" membership? Finally, Audible.com only permits 3 Kindle devices to be on your account. For my household, with 6 Kindles, this doesn't beget customer satisfaction, or a desire to become a member of Audible.com.Additionally, some of the free books linked to Whispersync for Voice I had previously purchased. Unfortunately, those editions would not link to Whispersync for Voice, meaning I had to re-purchase (albeit free) the book (different edition) to link to and then purchase (again with a free promotion) the audio book from Audible.com. For a paid version of a Kindle book that also has an audible version available but no link to Whispersync (those links are listed on the book product page) means you have to use a particular Kindle book with the particular companion Audible.com audible book. Bummer.7. Ads. Ads. Ads. For $199 I expect an Ad-free environment. Not here! You have to ""opt-out"" for an additional charge ($15). BAD MOVE for Amazon. Even then, once you opt-out, the continual ""suggestions"" are annoying and intrusive to the extreme. This does not exist on the original Kindle Fire.8. No SD card slot, a continuing Amazon deficiency (especially when dealing with content when you are out of Wi-Fi range), and no user replaceable battery. This is where my Kindle 1 shines. I keep categories of books on different SD cards because (obviously) the drive in K1 is inadequate to the task of taking my entire library along. The Kindle Keyboard (4 GB storage) houses my complete library, but not the Kindle Touch (2GB storage). You may ask, why is this important with the cloud drive available? Because ever since Amazon ripped my paid-for copy of George Orwell's 1984 off my Kindle without my permission, I do not trust my purchased content exclusively to Amazon's cloud drive. I back it up immediately to the computer.9. No Favorites section below the Carousel without going through the ""Favorites"" Star icon. Great when you can find it, annoying when you can't.10. Inconsistent displays on the Carousel. Not all items are displayed, they mysteriously disappear and reappear. When you tap them to open sometimes they do, and other times they just shake in place without opening. Other times, when trying to remove them from the Carousel, once you ""tap and hold"", the concurrent menu allowing you to remove the item from the device, the carousel or add/remove from Favorites does not appear at all. The ""shimmy"" effect of a vibrating icon on the Carousel is very disturbing (at least to me), making me wonder if it's trying to crash (aka a computer crash).12. No YouTube. No YouTube app that works.13. Email display is horrific both in portrait and landscape modes. Once an email is opened you have to scroll to read side-to-side, with a column list of your emails on the left (in landscape mode) which cannot be changed.14. Android Apps for Kindle Fire purchased for the original Kindle Fire may or may not (mostly not) work on the new Kindle Fire HD. When I asked about this, Customer Service told me they were ""working on it."" Right out of the box this is inexcusable. It's like saying, ""You can't have all your Kindle books which you purchased on this device because it is not going to work yet for those items"".15. Huge screen glare problem. Just gotta love seeing my face and the room around me while doing anything with this Kindle! The ""anti-glare screen protector"" recommended by Amazon is anything but anti-glare, and (conveniently) no other anti-glare screen protectors offered will fit the KFHD.16. The ""recommended"" case by Amazon only allows the KF to be installed one way and the display to face one way when using the stand, so you can't watch a movie even if you flip it over to view a movie in landscape mode while charging. Unfortunately, due to the location of the power cable (when plugged in), this makes it impossible to watch a movie using the case as a stand while the power cord is plugged in. The stand use of the case is unstable. If you read in bed, as I do, I find this to be a massive problem. The RooCase for the Original Kindle Fire accomplished both tasks for the original KF nicely.17. Camera only works with Skype (and Facebook with a lot of fiddling with an app to make it happen).My advice is PASS ON THIS PURCHASE. WAIT FOR KINDLE FIRE HD 3. Mine is going back, and I would advise anyone wanting a Kindle Fire to buy a refurbished original KF from Amazon (if any) or go to eBay. This one is too expensive and too buggy--perhaps released too quickly before fixing engineering and software glitches. For me, the Cons far outweighed the Pros to the point that this device is not for me. Hopefully my observations will help someone in their purchase decision. I really did want to keep this device; however, given the financial times and the inherent problems I have experienced with the KFHD, it is not worth the effort if you already have a Kindle Fire Original.Finally, given the above, I could not also justify buying an 8.9"" screen for the larger KFHD either. Buy an iPad instead if you want a bigger screen and easy email handling (yes, I have and use an iPad).For the convenience, I hope one day Amazon adds Text to Speech to the original KF, but til then my Kindle Keyboard keeps on keepin' on. Fine for me. The newer editions are (for me) a waste of time and money.REVIEW UPDATE:Even though I sent mine back, I decided to try one more time because I got a new one as gift. Because of continuing hardware problems, I am now on my 5th return of this item to Amazon (LOVE their customer service) by their request. KFHD #6 still has issues which cannot be resolved.NOTE WELL: MY REVIEW IS A COMPARISON OF THE NEW KFHD TO THE 1ST GEN KINDLE FIRE ONLY. Several comments to my review have been rude and mean, which has kept me from updating this review until now (Jan 2013).My 6th KFHD has solved the video color problem very well, but the previous 1,2,3,4,5 ones had speakers blow out when connected to a bluetooth device (ipod classic and an ipod touch). Bummer. I have not connected this one to a bluetooth speaker (Bose), nor will I in the future.STILL have email problems. Started using the paid email app which approximates the display of the amazon email app on the original KF. However, my ISP uses a Barracuda Spam Firewall Filter that sends an email for me to connect to my quarantined inbox to check if any emails need to go to the inbox rather than the quarantine box. The Barracuda link goes to a web page, but the web page only loads half-way and will NOT allow me to access the quarantine inbox. The old KF had no problem with this. None. The new one does not allow this function. AMAZON CUSTOMER SERVICE HAS ADMITTED THAT THIS IS A BROWSER GLITCH ON THEIR PART AND THEY HAVE NO INTENTION OF FIXING IT. 3 customer service agents have told me it is a known issue that Amazon will NOT solve. End of discussion. So if your ISP uses Barracuda, BEWARE.AS COMPARED TO THE ORIGINAL FIRE, THIS ONE IS STILL A DISAPPOINTMENT for me. As for you, only you can decide.",Is the option available?,[],[],[],[],[]

They store our files, they help us to communicate, we use them in our work, and much more.  Our computers have become an essential part of our lives, as necessary as a car or a microwave.  In some cases, a computer may be more important than some of the things we previously considered key devices in our life.As our expectations of our computers has grown, so too have our expectations regarding memory.  Just a short time ago, we thought 100's of megabytes (or even megabytes) was a lot of memory, only to find that even a terabyte could be filled with memories and entertainments.  Expansion drives provide a relatively cost effective way of adding storage to a computer, particularly if the computer is doing everything you need it to do with respect to processing power.This particular expansion drive seems to be a cost-effective way to add a lot of memory to a computer.  This drive is compatible with USB 3.0 and includes a USB 3.0 cable.  The transfer speed of USB 3.0 is about ten times faster than the previous, widespread standard, USB 2.0.  The faster speed means that, if you have a USB 3.0 interface on your computer, this expansion drive will appear to operate nearly as fast as your internal drive with respect to transferring files, except for very large files.  As one example, we loaded a movie (not high resolution) onto this drive and played the movie flawlessly from the drive.  The only flaw with the transfer speed is that it says nothing about the speed of the hard drive itself, which I was unable to figure out.  For the kinds of files I typically save, it was sufficiently fast.This drive is plug and play.  Connect the drive to your computer, and seconds later, it shows up as a drive on your directory.  The drive operates just like any other folder on your drive.  You may readily move files into and out from the drive, or launch files directly from the drive.  You should eject or shut down the drive before disconnecting it from your computer.While this drive seems to have a lot going for it, there are a couple of potential issues or annoyances, and one possible concern.This drive lays flat.  I have one other Seagate 2 TB external drive that stands up vertically.  I prefer the vertical arrangement because it takes up less space on the desk where I typically use the hard drive.  I have accidentally pulled the vertical hard drive over because I forgot to disconnect the cable, which is clearly not an issue with this hard drive, though that particular issue has not happened to me recently with my vertical external drive.Another possible problem is that this drive gets warm if it is used for very long.  One reason this could be an issue is the location where the drive is used.  Many people are heading to the desert in support of various U.S. initiatives and taking an expansion drive with them.  Since air conditioning is not ubiquitous in many of these locations, overheating is a potentially significant concern.Yet another incipient issue is decreased life.  I have seen some concerns regarding this particular drive and a shortened life, but the reports seem to be preliminary and may be isolated failures.  I think there is insufficient data at this point to be a cause for alarm, but neither am I sufficiently comfortable with the reliability of this drive to recommend it without a least a bit of reservation.  I suggest monitoring reviews on Amazon or doing some additional research to see whether these drives suffer from a shortened life.One thing I find troubling is the location of vent holes in the case.  I am a big fan of venting for electronics that have the potential to get warm.  This drive has vent holes on the bottom and on the back, but that does not necessarily optimize flow of air through the drive.  While the position of these holes prevents spilled fluids from readily entering the drive, the position of the holes is less than optimum from an airflow perspective, which may be part of the reason this drive seems to get warm.I now have several external drives.  I think the primary reason is my paranoia that highly valuable files will be lost because of some unforeseen and catastrophic circumstance.  I can replace my computer reasonably quickly, but I cannot replace the files on the computer.

Since she is pregnant with her 5th kid, I recommended this budget lens as an all-purpose affordable lens that gives a lot of bang for the buck. Personally, i shoot with the 50mm 1.4 which I love, but this does the trick, especially on a 1.6x body like the rebel xti. Anyone learning photography is wise to get a prime lens and learn to frame shots by moving around. Some say zoom lenses make people lazy. By moving around you can actually find better angles and shots than if you could just adjust a zoom. Sure, zooms are great, but prime's are both cheaper and better, and make better photographers, especially for someone just starting out with a dslr on a budget. The main difference to the 1.4 is the build quality is better on the 1.4 and the bokeh is smoother, not to mention a lower f-stop means lower light shooting without cranking up the ISO but not by much. This is perfectly adequate and for $104 on amazon, a no brainer.",How is the build of the canon t1i and kit lenses?,['is the build quality is better on the 1.4'],[793],[1],[0.],[False]

They've always done well for me, despite not being a top of the line headset. I've used them for music, movies, video chatting, and in game communication. They broke last week.I was tempted to simply order a new pair, but These Plantronics caught my eye. I decided to give it a shot. Here are some impressions.The Fit:They're a bit wider than I'm used to with a slightly tighter hold on the head than I'm used to. Not uncomfortable, just...noticeable. I'm confident this will fade with use. The gap inside the ear cup is roomy, and the circumaural padding is soft and comfortable. It seems to be covered in a microfiber of sorts which is pleasing to the touch, but do trap some more heat than may be comfortable. (I recommend removing these every hour or so, just to let your ears breathe a bit.) They headset can expand to accommodate what I can only imagine to be heads of cartoonish proportions, so sizing should not be an issue at all. The mic slides out and can bend a bit for suitable placement.The Look:Aesthetically, they're damn cool. Matte black with a translucent red color scheme, the hideaway mic...it looks good, undeniably so. The square cups give it a vaguely futuristic look, which may be a plus for some. Frankly, it makes little difference to me, but there it is anyway.The Sound:The bass is a bit flat at first listen, but not to a point where it makes a listening experience any less enjoyable. It handles voice very well, on both counts. People sound fine on say, skype or world of warcraft, and your voice is equally audible to people on the receiving end.The Build:The headset seems well made, from top to bottom. The cushions seem fairly durable, the plastic does not bend or stress in any way, the mic boom seems well built and the cord is fairly resilient. The in-line volume control and mute switch also seem to be well made, although the volume control seems a bit...unbalanced. (The volume change from 1 to 2 is much greater than the volume change from 2-3 or 3-4. Volume setting 2 seems to be more than adequate, at any rate. My only gripe is that the plugs are not color coded for mic and audio.",How is the padding?,[],[],[],[],[]

The price on this card is definitely better than I could find for other brands of the same size, as well.Update (07/13/12):I found a problem with this card if you're using it in a DSLR for video. I have a Canon T3i and when I shoot video sometimes (well, probably more than half of the time) it will stop recording either within seconds of hitting record or a couple minutes later. I did a search online and what it seems to be is when you go back through your card and delete certain photos or videos that aren't at the end of the sequence it leaves gaps in the memory, then when you record a video it tries to fill those gaps before continuing at the end of the memory card. Basically, I have to save everything to my computer and format my memory card while it's in my camera before doing any video shoots to make sure this doesn't happen. It seems to work fine if I do that. In theory, if you don't delete anything that's not at the end of the number sequence, it should work fine as long as you have room, but I don't always look at each picture and decide whether or not to delete it before taking another. I have read that this isn't an issue with some other brands like San Disk, but haven't tried for myself.

Buttons are large enough and well spaced so even larger hands should be fine.  The only tight spot is the directional pad with OK in the middle.  Need to be directly on the OK button to get it right but I have large fingers and have had trouble with remotes, phones etc forever.  Lights up as soon as you pick it up.

Did some research into lithium ion batteries and found out heat and over charging are the culprits.  So never leave it on charger for long periods and do not charge every day.  I toss it on there for one or two hours every few days.  Other interesting points about his type of battery: You should not let it go completely uncharged, ever.  If going to store it for a prolonged period try to get it around 40% to 50% charged before storing.  No need to worry about letting it lose most or all of it's charge before recharging, that applies to ni-cad batteries. Replacement batteries are all over the internet ranging from $6 to $20, so I plan to check monthly and pick up a new one at any sign of swelling, although I bet overcharging is the main reason most people get swollen battery.",How many small complaints are there about this?,[],[],[],[],[]

I own 4 of these ""kits"", basically the D3100 and the 18-55 lens.  My company does high volume photography, mostly sports, schools and events (we will photograph over 90,000 kids this year) and I thought I would give these a shot to see how they would hold up for some of my basic sports portraits shoots and I am pleasantly surprised.  Make note of the word PORTRAITS after sports, we do not use these for action.I actually compared this, side by side, shot by shot with the Canon T2i when deciding which way to go since I was going to be purchasing so many of them.  It was actually a pretty big decision since I was deciding on a Nikon camera when my personal camera is a Canon 7D.  When comparing the 2 cameras I literally set them up on tripods right next to each other, took shots in the exact same settings, conditions, etc.  First, I compared everything in Manual mode, then I let the camera do the work in Shutter Priority, Aperture Priority and full Program Mode.  Without running through every single shot I can simply say the Nikon D3100 beat the Canon t2i, much to my surprise.  This was a VERY close comparison and, in the end, the price of the Nikon helped tip the scale in that direction.Image QualityThe D3100 wins here.  How, you say, is that possible?  The Canon is 18 megapixel and the Nikon is only 14.2...true, but Nikon has a secret weapon, the 18-55 lens!  Believe it or not, the 18-55 Nikon lens, the KIT lens that comes on this camera and many others, is actually one of the sharpest images Nikon makes.  I wouldn't believe it if I hadn't taken hundreds of shots, blown them up to 100% and compared them side by side.  Now, if you are looking for something where you plan to change lenses from time to time, then the Canon is the better choice.  However, in the case of my very specific needs, where I will never need to change out the lens on this camera because it is for sports portrait shoots only, you cannot beat the D3100.  I actually chose the Canon for another area of my business out of state where I needed more durability and flexibility...more on that in another review.As with any product, it will ultimately boil down to how you plan to use it.  If you are a consumer who is just getting into Digital SLR cameras, this is a great way to start.  It is cheap and it takes great images.  It has video, which is nice, although I do not use it so I can't give an in depth review of that functionality.  Make sure that you get the kit with the 18-55 lens though, that makes a big difference in image quality.It also has a great little feature that would be really helpful to beginners trying to understand how Aperture works.  It has a little animation on the LCD screen that shows an actual camera iris opening or closing as you adjust the aperture, which is helpful for beginners trying to understand the lower number being a bigger aperture concept.So, to sum it up:PROS:Price: You can't beat it, if you watch Amazon closely you will be able to catch it in the $500 range or maybe a bit less if you are luckyImage Quality:  Really amazing image quality WITH the 18-55 lens especially.Good for Beginners:  Has some really good tutorials to help beginners understand the basics of DSLR.Great ""Auto"" settings:  Produces really nice images on many of the standard settings for Shutter and Aperture Priority and full Program.  (although I recommend to beginners to try to learn how to shoot in Manual mode at least to understand how it works and NEVER use any of the silly settings like ""Sports"" or the other ones.)CONS:Not very tough:  It feels a lot cheaper than the CanonReally small:  It looks ridiculous with an SB900 flash on it!  (This is a con for me but might be a pro for others)Overall, I definitely recommend it for a beginner or someone with a very specific professional need like I have.  It earns 5 stars for how I use it.",What is the most important flaw?,[],[],[],[],[]

Mostly bought it for the keyboard as I already own 2 cases one of which is the Pong. Setup was a breeze, barely had to look at the instructions. Mostly because I know when an accessory contains a battery, it should be brought up to full charge first. The User Guide is simple, easy to understand and use. Pairing the keyboard to the iPad bluetooth was straightforward and the connection is persistent when the case and iPad are separated and reunited.The feel of the keyboard is nice and even with my large hands the key size feels comfortable. The case is surprisingly light for its seemingly durable construction. Only time can test the actual durability but I have no initial concerns about this. The magnetic auto shutoff works great but you have to remember to keep the landscape orientation in the right direction. I rotated the case so that the charging cable could feed from the other direction and simply closed the case after use. I was surprised when I reopened the case and the battery was almost completely discharged. It took me a little while to realize what I had done. Easy lesson learned.I like the adjustability of the stand support but sometimes when it is in the case, it takes a little tweaking of the positions to get the iPad to sit solidly. A small price to pay for the flexibility of position choices. Bottom line, I bought this case for the keyboard, and to my surprise I received a light, durable case that gave me an incredible number of choices for positioning my iPad, even free standing.

I don't have numbers but everybody in the house (3 teenagers!# happily streams Netflix and hulu etc. and I still have bandwidth for my work.The previous Linksys routers all had decent parental controls. I could create rules and activate them based on time. This device has extremely rudimentary controls. Essentially not usable. You can't block multiple devices or multiple sites at the same time. The control allow the user to pick on/off times for each rule on a nifty time grid, but each rule can only affect one device or one website.The connected device manager is an improvement over previous versions but it still could be better. I have devices show up multiple times #same MAC#. Some devices don't show up #only 4 of 5 Sonos components show up). I like that I can name each device and give it icons.I really like the GuestNet feature. Super easy to set up. Your guest just connect to your network and automatically get asked a password (which you can set, and which is NOT your regular Wifi password) and they're connected to the internet but NOT your network. I like this for three reasons: 1) I can change my guest network if I'm worried about neighbors or WiFi hijackers. 2) I can make my regular WiFi password much more complicated and thus stronger because my guests don't have to type it in; and 3) My guests can't get access to my files so I can remove one level of password protection from my networked computers. This is a great feature.Things I would like to see improved:The web interface is incompatible with IE11 !!! Had to re-install Google Chrome!!!The interface WAN speed check app is iPad incompatible! It's flash based.The parental controls need to be improved. I would like to see the ability turn multiple devices or websites on and off at different times.

Each has different needs for internet access because their school times are different and website access and times are different for different ages.The speed check utility needs to run on ipads.The device list manager needs to work more reliably, i.e. show all devices and then only once.I would really like to see a network map.Guest Network is great! I would love to see an email notification service so I get emails when guest sign in or out. Similar to my NAS sending me error messages.Overall I think this is a well functioning device.

We used to cart around jam boxes with mix tapes, but now our computers, smart phones, tablets and just about any internet connected device can access our online music library. The speakers on these devices are just horrible and sometimes, I don't want to have headphones on. I wanted a nice sounding small unit that would allow me to enjoy music anywhere from just about any device.The JAMBOX is small, easy to use, sounds very good for background music, is an excellent design and even runs on batteries.SIZE: this thing is very small, you can take it anywhere and tuck it away in a place where it almost disappears. All you get is music.DESIGN: These folks included a simple interface that uses only four buttons and voice feedback to tell you how to pair a device, charging status and much more. It comes with a manual, but honestly, you can set this up with no trouble out of the box. It is well constructed with a nice feel. It even looks good.BLUETOOTH CALLING: The bluetooth implementation works for sound and as a speakerphone. I was not purchasing this as a speakerphone but WOW, this things is great for conferencing as long as everyone is in front of it. Yes it has an integrated microphone. Rejection is very good, we could all clearly hear the caller and they could hear us as well.SOUND: The sound is actually very good for background music. You won't get big stereo sound field, excellent imaging, thumping bass or dance party volume levels -- but what you do get is actually quite impressive. The sound is balanced from top to bottom and is actually very natural. Acoustic music with vocals like James Taylor, Nora Jones or Shane Jackman are reproduced with excellent balance and clarity. Electronic pop music can lack the dynamics and extended bass, but the bass you do get is not boomy and sounds very natural. One more thing about the bass, it is actually amazing this little thing puts out as much bass as it does for the size. If you are worried the JAMBOX will not play loud, it will, just not THUMPING loud. Because of the smooth high end and good tonal response, you can listen to this thing for a long time with almost no fatigue.BLUETOOTH MUSIC: As most devices, the BlueTooth audio is not as good as if you use the 1/8 audio jack. If you want the best sound plug your phone or computer into this thing. It will amaze you. You may need to turn your headphone output down some so as not to overdrive the unit. It will get a little distorted. The BlueTooth sound is very good, just not as good as when using the plug. Jawbone does something very interesting with the BlueTooth audio. Some devices with BlueTooth audio can be overdriven with the audio output from the source and will distort in at the higher levels. I play guitar and some distortion is good, but not on prerecorded music. NO! The folks at JamBox know then and use something called compression to dynamically limit the amount of sound from your device to the JAMBOX when your BlueTooth level is to high. This compression can sound like 70's pop radio where all the dynamics form the music are taken out. if this bothers you, turn your device (phone/iPod/computer) BlueTooth volume down until the compression is eliminated then use the volume on the JAMBOX to adjust the sound. BUGE IMPROVEMENT.In summary, of the BT Speakers out, this one is the best value for me.

On sale, it was the same price as the Nostromo and I am a huge Razer fan and can't live without my Naga and Vespula. That said, I have always only used Logitech keyboards and headsets and I love them just as much. This truly was a difficult decision for me and I pored over the reviews of both for days.I'm so happy with the choice I made. I can't speak to the Nostromo as I haven't used one, but I can't imagine life being any better than it is with my G13 right now. Let me say straight out, this is not as valuable for non-MMO type games which require a ridiculous number of hotkeys to perform at your best. Games like Skyrim where you're basically just moving around with WASD and attacking with two buttons will not see the huge improvements that your MMOs will experience, but it's still a very nice upgrade in terms of comfort, especially for laptop users. The G13 will serve you well in any game that requires the keyboard because it allows your wrist and arm to be in a more natural position. I can completely relax my arm rather than have to try to hover over the keyboard for long gaming sessions. I have found that the G13 works amazingly well even when not on a flat surface. I regularly play in bed on my laptop and I usually rest the base of the G13 against my thigh so that it's at an angle to the bed (if that makes sense!) and this is surprisingly awesome. I have no loss in control over playing on a flat surface and my arm can be completely relaxed at my side the entire time. It's easily tied for the best accessory you can buy for your gaming laptop, equaled only byRazer Naga MMOG Laser Gaming Mouse. Paired with aRazer Vespula Dual-Sided Gaming Mouse Matyou will only have to touch your keyboard if you use text to chat. If you use voice chat over Ventrilo or Teamspeak, your keyboard will be collecting dust from lack of use. What I love about this setup is the ability to have both of my hands at my sides when I'm using my gaming laptop and I'm supremely comfortable. Mobile gaming is the future and I want to be able to take my games with me and be comfortable wherever I play while still being as effective as possible. The G13 is a huge part of what makes this possible.Now don't get me wrong, I also love my G13 with my desktop PC. The profiles are stored on the gameboard so I can easily move it from computer to computer with no issue. It works great on a desk being nicely weighted and with a good grip on the base. It doesn't slip or give without excessive force (and no one games THAT hard!). The design is also perfect. I was truly concerned because I have smaller hands and that is actually a big factor behind this purchase. With smaller hands, it's hard to reach across a keyboard to hit all those hotkeys. I read a lot of reviews claiming the G13 is not kind to small hands but I have not found that to be the case. With my palm resting comfortably on the designated rest, I can easily reach the top row of keys. The furthest on the left and right are a bit of a stretch for constant use but I find G1 in the upper left is perfect for TAB and targeting mobs. The one just below is nice for SPACE or jump. I use the top five center keys for 1-5 and the five directly below for 6-10. I have no trouble accessing any of them at any time and I adjusted to the new positions really quickly, faster than I learned to use my Razer Naga by far. I mapped the keys near the joystick to M and L for map and quest log. And of course, the joystick has completely replaced my WASD keys for movement. Moving with a joystick is so natural, especially for console gamers, even casual ones like myself. I have none of the issues others have mentioned about it hurting their thumbs or being hard to push. A very gentle push is all that's needed to continuously move forward. Diagonals are possible also. I tend to hold forward on the joystick and mouse steer because that's what I'm used to, but I find myself turning with the joystick more and more and it works great. Now my fingers are completely free to access my primary hotkeys rather than trying to contort my hand to reach WASD keys and hotkeys simultaneously. I have my secondary hotkeys assigned to my Razer Naga and I'm good to go with split second response time thanks to all keys being within my natural reach without straining.The best tip I can give new users who are having trouble accessing keys is to remap them manually for each game that you play. It really only takes a few minutes to do and once it's done, you don't have to worry about it again. By default, WoW's map is set up so that the center keys on the gameboard are assigned to WASD. This made no sense to me because I wanted to get away from using my fingers for movement and do it all with my thumb on the joystick. The key profiling software is very user friendly and easy to understand without ever looking at the manual. You just click the G key you want to change in the interface, and then press the key you want it to be. Easy. I remapped all my keys so that they would work for ME. I appreciate all the effort Logitech put into pre-designing key layouts for so many games, but ultimately what's going to work best for you is a layout you choose yourself. Pick keys that are easy to reach (which should be most of them, even for small hands) for your primary abilities and use the ones that are a bit of a stretch (if any) to lesser used functions, like map, bag and quest log. I've seen so many reviews where people complain that the keys aren't in the right place. Change them!My only regret is that I didn't buy one sooner. The G13 has changed my gaming for the better, and with kids, school and work, I want the most out of my game time, and now I have it. Thank you once again, Logitech!",What software do you want to use?,[],[],[],[],[]

Hands down this is a better product.  It looks nicer.  It has many more positions to place the ipad in--meaning that it rises and lowers at better angles.  The apple ipad cover fell completely short of being something that holds the IPAD in a position that i'm comfortable with.  I like it raised slightly higher--gives better viewing and better ability to use the keyboard.Even the apple store guy said he did not like the limitations  of the ipad cover and recommended a leather cover alternative.I don't know how this will hold up in a year--but to me, the price was cheap enough that it doesn't matter if it falls apart in a year.  It seems like it will be durable though.While some might be comfortable using this cover while the IPAD is standing, I only like to use it in landscape mode.  It seems too unstable standing.You can not use the cover while docking the IPAD in a docking station, however, you can hook it up to the computer or charger without a docking station.I am happily returning the $40 apple IPAD cover and keeping this.  And strongly urging you to not hesitate to buy this.There is an elastic strap on the top corner, inside the cover, to keep the IPAD in place.  The snap that holds the cover closed, remains loose when the cover is open.  That bothers me slightly--just because i don't like the look of it that way.  The  Kick stand (for lack of a better word) is magnetized with what seems to be a sufficient enough magnet to hold it in place when you don't need to use it.With all of that said--I wouldn't pay $70 for this--then again, i can't imagine paying $70 for any IPAD cover.

While I do have electrical engineering knowledge and understand many of the specs that can be compared amongst speaker sets, I cannot discern some of the subtle differences that true audio technicians can.  On the other hand, I am also picky about sound quality and am able to immediately notice many aspects of speaker design based on how they affect the sound of a song.With that said, my appraisal of the Klipsch Promedia 2.1 system is a 5-star rating.  These high-quality speakers are excellently designed, admirably built, and deliver outstanding sound quality whether they are used with music, movies, or video games.First off, the speakers themselves are wonderful.  Featuring strong midrange drivers and bright ""horn style"" tweeters (a Klipsch tradition), they deliver the full range of frequencies contained in a typical audio track.  In this regard they surpass competition such as Logitech, which lacks good midrange abilities.  The Klipsch speakers are good enough to draw out flaws in lower quality audio tracks, which can be mildly annoying, but is a great testimony to the quality of the drivers and filters.Now, the subwoofer.  I demand GOOD bass from my music.  I hate deafeningly loud, boomy bass units that obscure the higher frequencies and irritate everyone within a half mile radius.  On the other hand, weak bass drivers that rattle and vibrate or distort when the music is turned up are also an abomination.  The Klipsch subwoofer, which runs at 50 watts continuously and can peak at 130 watts, is perfect for in-home audio use.  While it probably would not be sufficient to overcome road noise in a car (I have a 150 watt subwoofer there), it is more than ample for a home theater system.  I absolutely love the sound of the bass from this thing; while it is ported, which generally makes for boomier bass, the Klipsch unit does deliver very tight, clean bass.  A former roommate who was arguably much more of an ""audiophile"" than myself even commented with approving surprise about the great resonance the sub has at low frequencies.  Again, this sub might appear to be weak at only 50 watts RMS, but it is MORE than sufficient.  If you turn up the volume loud enough to start distorting or rattling the subwoofer, you will be completely deafened by the satellites.Features are where the Klipsch speakers lose a few points from the overall rating...but not very many.  Like most computer speakers, they feature a decently lengthy input cord (1/8"" [3.5mm] stereo mini-jack), headphone port, and volume adjustment on the primary satellite.In addition, three features stand out as especially nice.  First, there is an additional input port (female 1/8"" [3.5mm] stereo mini-jack) which means you can play music and video games at the same time, for example.Next, the speakers are connected to the amplifier/subwoofer unit via detachable 2-wire speaker cords, NOT hardwired cords.  This means you have a lot of flexibility in the placement of the units; additionally, the included wires are very long.  If they aren't long enough, you could also solder an extra length of ordinary speaker wire to the amplifier end because they simply clip into place.  The satellite ends have 1/8"" jacks on them which plug firmly into the back of the satellites.Lastly, the subwoofer can be fully adjusted via a knob on the primary satellite, meaning you can turn it down or even off without affecting the volume of the music.  This is great in apartments and dorms where the bass is OK during the day but must be toned down at night to avoid disturbing people.The one feature of the set that is NOT a plus would be the placement of the power switch.  In order to prevent that awful popping noise that occurs when you power up a speaker set remotely (such as by flipping the switch on a power strip), you'll want to use the unit's built-in power switch.  Unfortunately, this is located on the back lower part of the amplifier/subwoofer, under the wiring connections and generally in a place where you will have trouble reaching.  Usually, the sub gets tucked away under a desk or in a corner, and thus the switch location is rather terrible.  Logitech systems, for example, often have a remote or hardwired control pod which includes power and volume controls.Build quality on the speakers is also a plus.  The subwoofer is sturdy and rugged MDF, with a quality black coating and a firmly attached rear amplifier panel.  The satellites are injection molded plastic, but it is thick and strong, and the bases (which can be removed for optional wall mounting) are coated metal.  I have had the speakers for several years now and they have never once acted up on me or required repair.All in all, the Klipsch Promedia 2.1 set is a phenomenal, spectacular set of speakers for a relatively cheap, 2.1 style unit that was designed with computer audio in mind.  With a few adapters, you can easily use this with your TV, XBox, and many other devices, as I currently do.  Again, larger home audio units will provide better and louder sound, but these will also cost a great deal more.  I would highly recommend these speakers to anyone who needs a compact setup but demands good quality sound.",How is the speaker clear?,[],[],[],[],[]

You're TV should have several &#34;source&#34; connections (where the source program inters the TV).  The remote control should have a &#34;source&#34; selector.

I am a NetFlix subscriber so I just added &#34;ON-DEMAND&#34; services for a few extra dollars a month.Roku 3 has a very small remote control.  It's very easy, comes with ear buds to plug into the remote for private listening, and the remote works on Radio Frequencies instead of Infra-Red to communicate with the Roku.  This means that the remote does NOT have to have an unobstructed line-of-sight to the Roku.It sounds like, from what I've read, some of the earlier models are very good also.

The review has been accurate in my case and I have seen an improvement in both range and performance over my previous WRT 350N  router.On the downside like many reviews I read I found the firmware to be unstable.  That is within the first 24 hours the router had dropped all the wireless connections in the house and devices were not able to connect consistently.  Having read many reviews and some forums I knew this was a possibility but I also new that I had options.  There are 3 alternative firmware versions available that will all work on this router so if the stock asus firmware is not fitting the bill you have a choice of Merlin, Tomato or DD-WRT.  At this point however a simple update to the latest Asus firmware resolve my problem and the router has been stable since that time.There are some other things I do not like about the Asus software:Parental Controls - The only option here is to set a calendar of access times.  The Web 2.0 interface is awkward and you must set a different schedule for each MAC address.  I found it time consuming and problematic.  I would have preferred to create an access class assign the schedule to the access class and then assign the MAC address to the class.  But at least I was able to disable WIFI during nighttime hours so my children aren't watching HULU or worse all night in bed.Static IP - While it gives you the ability to create leases, you cannot name them.  And as such the DNS from the router will not serve a name for them.  This has been a feature I have used for a while and has been available on every previous router that I have purchased.  It makes it easy to setup a static entry for my ReadyNAS, and networked Xerox printer and then access them in a browser by name instead of IP.  All of the alternative firmwares provide this capability so I will likely switch to one of them, going to try Merlin first as it has the best performance.QoS - I really don't get it, why would you invent your own version of QoS when a standard 802.11Q already exists and would make your device compliant with other devices that also support the standard such as my 24 port gigabit switch.  The lack of this feature has effectively nullified the capability on my 24 port switch as I have no congestion within the switch, only when accessing the internet.  Instead they provide a very dumbed down custom QoS implementation that has been very buggy by all reports.  I am hoping that I might be able to get 802.11q with DDWRT or Tomato, but doubt that Merlin will provide it.In general the interface is just simplified, and it is clear that it was intended for the novice user.  Some advanced features are available, but for the most part it is designed for the non-technical user.To be clear, I find the problems above endemic across all SOHO offerings.

The first one I received had a bad dent in the top of the tablet right on the top of the volume rocker.  Woot agreed to replace it.  The second one I received was in ""like new"" condition.  Overall I reallly like this tablet.  Since updating it with the new KitKat OS the tablet is very responsive and I don't experience any lags that other people reported.  I did start having video problems with certain feeds with the new OS.  I would get a choppy, distorted image and bad pixelation. I found that by forcing all video to be rendered by the GPU, (by enabling the develooper options) solved this problem. Samsung has a bug somewhere and needs to fix this with an update.  I also wish Android and Adobe would sort out the Flash video fiasco.  Please kill this dead technology and get everyone on to HTML 5.  Instead Adobe keeps pushing it which makes life miserable for everyone on Android and Apple devices.  Developers need to be mandated to get off of the FLASH content as the industry has agreed to move to HTML5.  Yes, I know, you can still use Flash on this device, but it is a PITA to implement.One thing that is very nice is that you can work with two applications on a split screen at the same time on this tablet.  The downside is that you can only do this with select applications.  Samsung used to have a little tab on the left of the screen to pull the eligible apps out to choose for split screen work.  Once KitKat came out it is now on the right hand side of the screen with no visible tab.  What I don't like about this is you have applications that you swipe content from right to left and you end up pulling this tab out by accident. (Very annoying)  They should have left it where it was.  Samsung has media apps that flip pages from right to left - so putting the split screen applications on the right hand side of the screen makes no sense.  Samsung are you listining?The screen image is nice.  It is not ""Blow me away"" nice - but the resolution is very good.  The colors are very accurate for viewing pictures and watching movies.  It does not use a super Amoled screen and in my opinion other screens look better even though this tablet has higher resolution.  Why Samsung didn't use a super Amoled screen on this expenisve device is questionable.  The screen is very bright and most of the time I have the brightness at 50% or less.The part I thought I would like the best was the S-Pen.  Unfortunatelly, to me this is still awkard to use.  The only pen that works acurately with this tablet is the one that you get with the tablet.  I can't stand writing with this very thin writing instrument.  Samsung also doesn't give you any replacement nibs for it and it is almost impossible to find them anywhere.  I tried multiple other thicker OEM pens including Samsungs own S-pen with eraser for Galaxy note tablets, but all of them have a noticeable offset when writing which makes them unuseable for any fine writing work.  Why a vendor can't make a useable aftermarket pen for this device is a mystery to me.  I e-mailed Wacom, (who apparently makes the pens for Samsung) but they never responded back to me.  I wanted to buy their Bamboo ""Feel"" pen, as it was wider, but too many reviews said it also had this offset issue.  I guess I won't be buying their pen either.  So - if you want this for the writing capability, plan on using the very thin pen that comes with it and when the nib wears out, having to purchase another new pen.  In fact, I'd buy a second one now unless you can find the replacement nibs.  Apparently you can purchase them from Samsung directly, but I spent an hour on a chat line with Samsung service and got no where with them.  If they do have them, I'll bet it is cheaper to buy a whole new pen.Writing on the tablet is NOT like writing with paper and pen.  I don't care what anyone says,  In my opinion it is awkward at best and I have been practicing for quite some time.  Lecture Notes is the best app available for taking notes on this device but it is difficult to configure and set up.  Once you figure it out, it does give you some good functionality.  It also allows you to record lectures with audio and write notes at the same time.  Samsung has their own apps for taking notes but they could be integrated better and in my opinion, are not as good as the Lecture Notes application.  Hopefully Samsung will keep improving their applications for note taking.Battery life is acceptable but not great.  I usually get 1 day of use out of it with heavy use.  I simply charge it over night so I really don't care how long it takes to charge.  It has a very big baterry in it to feed a very powerfull processor so it is going to take a while to charge it back up.  I also hate not being able to replace the battery in these devices.  You actually can - but you have to watch some Youtube videos and do some minor surgery to accomplish this.  I figure by the time the battery wears out I'll probably want something newer anyway.I do like the media integration that Samsung put on this tablet.  The flip up from bottom of the screen function to receive your news, social media, etc. is very nice. Samsung also has a magazine/news application included which is very nice and well integrated into the tablet. They also include a free trial to Zinio for subscribing to magazines.  I'm sorry, but a 10 inch tablet is just not a good reading experience for magazines.  I find I constantlly have to zoom into the text to read them.I actually like the Samsung integrated application launcher and think they did a nice job of making the Android experience better.  Don't expect to get much help with learning this tablet.  I found the information on how to use it is scattered all over the internet.  Most of what I learned, I learned from other reviewers of the tablet.The tablet is quite expensive.  I saved about a hundred bucks buying it refurbished, but it still is more expensive than most tablets. However, when you consider the hardware this has I think it is worth it.  First you get two sets of quad core processors.  One set is for high power use and the other one is to save battery life when using applications that don't need the processing speed.  You get a six core video processor.  You get 3GB's of internal System RAM and 32GB of internal RAM.  I also applaud Samsung for letting you use an external micro SD card.  I have a 64GB card in mine and now 128GB micro cards are coming on the market.  This will certainly give this tablet longevity, allowing me to use it for years.The build quality of the tablet is average.  It's not bad, (don't get me wrong) its just not great.  They make a big deal about the stiched leather look on the back, but it is just plain old plastic.  So why bother?  Nothing about the tablet exudes quality to me.  For the price, Samsung should have included a case for it and made the actual unit out of metal alloy.  I purchased the Roo leather case which has been great.  It comes with a very protective leather cover that you can zip the tablet into and has a nice leather wrap around the tablet itself.  I wanted something that protected the tablet in case I dropped it.  In my opinion, this is the best case for the money as it is all leather.Overall I'm very happy with this tablet.  Yes, there are some minor issues with it and I still don't think the S-pen is everything it is cracked up to be.  I hope Samsung keeps improving it and comes up with better S-pen functionality.I would highly recommend this tablet, but would encourage you to look for discounts as Samsung has just announced that it will be replacing these with newer models this summer. (Including super amoled displays)  Plan on paying a premium for these newer models.In summary:Pros:Very responsive and powerful Tablet (Two sets of quad core processors- six core video)3GB of internal System RAMHigh Screen resolution - (best in class)Accurate screen colors - very bright screenSamsung's app launcher is nicely integrated to make the user experience better than stock Android in my opinion.32GB of internal RAM, can use an external micro SDHC card adding 64GB of user RAM (128GB coming)Can run two applications at once on the same screen (No other tablet can do this today)(However, apps that can do this are limited and you have to swipe from right to left to do it which inteferes with other apps) Even so - being able to have both your e-mail and browser up at the same time is nice. (Even two browser windows at the same time!Needs improvement:Quality and feel of tablet is mediocre and feels cheap for the money you pay.  (Back plastic stiching is cheesy and doesn't fool anyone)S-Pen needs improvement.  Biggest complaint is no other S-pen can be used with an offset issue - pen is too thin.Battery is adequate but could be better.  Plan on getting a full day out of it max in heavy use.  (Charge time is slow)No super Amoled screen.  Screen is very good - but not as good as Amoled screens on other devices with less resolution.Expect a long learning curve with information scattered all over the web.Expensive - Look for a refurbished or discounts to lower the price - otherwise wait for the new models to come outSamsungs customer support is not the best but is on par with everyone's lousy customer service these days.There is no perfect tablet on the market today.  The issues I raised are minor and overall, I still think this is one of the best tablets you can buy today.  If you can find a discount on this tablet, go for it.  You won't be disappointed.  I still think it is the best overall tablet you can buy at this time.",What's the high resolution?,[],[],[],[],[]

Even though I wasn't actively looking for a keyboard, it met two requirements I had for an HTPC keyboard to replace the existing one.1 - The mouse is not targeted to right handers.  As a left hander, I am continually frustrated by Mice that are unusable for me.2 - Range - I had been using a MS Laser 5000 keyboard and mouse on the HTPC.  The range was so limited that one had to sneak up on the computer to get things to work.  The advertised range for the Wireless Desktop 3000 was 30 feet.  That caught my attention so I purchased one and sure enough if works fine from across the room.  That in itself makes the purchase worthwhile.They also advertise that the mouse works on any surface and it seems to.  I can sit on the sofa and use the mouse on the arm of the sofa with no problems.  However, the 5000 mouse is equally responsive on any surface, it just doesn't have the range.Unfortunately, the keyboard design has changed from the Wireless 5000.  The key layout has changed enough that I wouldn't want to have to switch between the 3000 and 5000 for normal use (both of my desktops use the 5000) but for the HTPC where we don't do a lot of typing the new keyboard is fine.The ESC, function, PrtScrn, ScrLock, and Pause keys have been miniaturized as have all of the dedicated function keys.  The keys are also aligned straight across the keyboard as opposed to the curved design of the 5000.  One would thing that the ergonomics of keyboards would be pretty well understood by now but we keep changing them with every new iteration.From my perspective, if you like your current keyboard and mouse there is no reason to make an impulse purchase (I bought mine at Sam's on impulse mainly for the range).  However if you need a new keyboard on have an old mouse that's finicky of some surfaces, this keyboard may well suit your needs.Microsoft Wireless Desktop 3000",How to receiver size?,[],[],[],[],[]

We have owned Canon's prior model, the SX40, for just 2 months and loved it. When the SX50 came out, we were tempted, but skeptical about the faster auto focus and the additional zooming ability. We decided to give it a try. The verdict: Canon managed to noticeably improve on an already excellent product, and we bit the bullet and bought the new model.Here are our observations:General impression: the camera is light, has a nice grip, and takes amazing bird pictures even with free hands. The image quality further improves with the aid of a light tripod. When it comes to landscape pictures, the image is less ideal (less sharp) comparing to those taken by Canon S95, a compact camera we own. So our solution is to carry both cameras (both are so light) if we want to have excellent pictures for birding/wild life and landscape.Below is a direct comparison between SX50 and SX40:Auto focus: It really is much faster and more reliable than the SX40's. This is a big deal, particularly for taking pictures of birds.1200mm zoom: This sounds too good to be true for free-hand shooting with a compact camera and in a way it is. At some point cropping yields better results than zooming. So I was skeptical whether SX50's extra zooming ability would really add any value compared to the SX40. Some extensive testing revealed that the SX50 performs equally well as the SX40 at the same (840mm) zoom level. When zooming in further, there is some additional resolution (sharper image) compared to cropping. However, the added value is small and disappears in all but at the very best lighting conditions.Aperture: The aperture numbers are less than stellar: 3.4W-6.5T. Keep in mind though that at 1200mm poor aperture numbers are simply a fact of life. Also worth mentioning: At around 840mm, the aperture is the same as the SX40's, so no loss there. That being said, I would not recommend using this camera except for its amazing zooming ability. In the standard or wide angle range most any compact camera will deliver better results than the SX50.In summary, the SX50 is an amazing camera if used for the special purpose that it is good for. This includes birding, wild life photography, and anything else that really needs zooming in to the max. However, this is not an all-purpose camera. If your main need is to take amazing landscape pictures, other compact cameras would be a better option. (For higher quality images, we use Canon S95 or 5D depending on weight restrictions).Worth mentioning: Before we purchased our SX40, we also tested Nikon P510. SX40 outperformed P510 in auto focus (speed & reliability) and picture quality (sharpness).Useful accessories to greatly improve image quality:- Sirui T-1204X: ultra lightweight and super sturdy tripod, essential to keep the ISO low.SIRUI 4 Section Pro Carbon Fiber Tripod T1204x with Professional Travel Bag- Sirui G-10 ball head: lightweight and smooth.

However, upon configuring it properly, I managed to get a better DL speed and a somewhat improved UL speed as well. Also, I recently tested it on two other Wi-Fi networks. There was improvement in the internet access speeds in both cases. In one of networks the improvement was significantly higher, exceeding my initial expectations.The product took a while to install, partly because it was counter-intuitive, and partly because it didn't have proper help on the GUI. Eventually I figured it out and it started working alright.As I don't use Win 7, I cannot rate its compatibility with this OS.The range is alright, meeting my expectations. Strangely, if it's a few feet away from the router, the signal is just ""Good"" or ""Very good"" at times, although it should be ""Excellent"" at all times (after all, it's in close proximity and without any physical objects in between). However, it sometimes is ""Excellent"" despite the distance or physical obstacles being in between the adapter and the router.The USB extension cord accessory is a plus, since it allows you to relocate the adapter to optimize its performance. It didn't improve things much in my case though. Still, it's a useful thing to have, particularly if you are using it with a desktop computer, or with a laptop at home.Bottom line: this product is definitely an improvement but not so easy to get it working as it might seem. It's definitely worth the twenty bucks though and, just like the Medialink router, it is a very reliable and handy piece of technology.",Which there a wireless  capability?,[],[],[],[],[]

The camera has a nice metal case and attractive appearance.  It is nice and heavy (doesn't feel light and cheap like the Creative).  Included in the box is the camera, a nice felt bag, a nicer-than-necessary quality wrist strap that is detachable, and Quickstart guide.  The power button isn't marked, but I figured out it is the button on the side.  The controls are simple and intuitive.USABILITYIt is obviously designed to be very, very simple.  No fancy features, no detailed customization, not even a picture mode.  Video at 720p PERIOD.  (Flip website: 16:9 widescreen, HD 720p (1280 x 720) at 30 frames per seconds (fps) progressive scan; recorded as MP4 files)  This is what they designed it to do, so it makes sense.  The Creative adds a picture mode, but still has a similar arrangement of buttons, so it is not as easy to get it to do what you want.  With the Flip, the buttons are +/-, left/right, play/trash, record and power.  The +/- and left/right buttons are touch sensitive areas, not buttons, so it is difficult to use them without looking at them.  However, they are backlit, and the buttons that apply for the mode you are in are lit and the ones with no function are dark, which is very nice.VIDEO QUALITYThe video quality is good, although there is a certain expectation that it is not the same quality picture are a larger HD camera could give you, like theSanyo VPC-FH1 HD 1080p Flash Memory Camcorder w/ 16x advance zoom (Black).  After all, the lens can be measured in millimeters.  It certainly exceeds the quality of my iPhone 3GS video, which is much lower in resolution (watch out for iPhone 4!, Flip).  This would certainly be good for Youtube or Facebook sharing of up-close things, but not good at all for anything very far away (tiny lens = no zooming).EASE OF TRANSFERRING/WATCHINGI love how Flip, et al, have made transferring so easy.  Hopefully the days of proprietary connectors and dozens of special cables will soon be behind us.  You just pull the switch to allow the USB connector to pop out the top and hook it up!  It is not bendable, so it is not going to be practical for many users, so you'll need a USB extension cable (can be purchased for cheap online).  Creative does a nice job with a flexible connector, by the way.  I didn't try the video software, but copying the video onto the computer is as simple as copy and paste or just a drag.Hooking it up to your HDTV via mini-HDMI to HDMI cable is a great feature, also, that is great for showing friends or family.Overall, this is a very sturdy, simple device designed for one purpose; and it does it well.  Just don't expect to take it to your next graduation, high school musical or wedding if you're not upfront.Longer-term, I think this category of digital video recorders cannot withstand the onslaught of phones that will be able to do the same thing.[UPDATE 4/12/11] It was announced today that Cisco is killing the Flip business; I guess I predicted correctly.",Is the video quality good?,[],[],[],[],[]

All it takes is a few connections/disconnections to wear through the gold plating to the metal conductor unserlying the gold.  A high quality steel connector is better in the long run.  Also, the wire is not unusually thick which means that it may lose conductivity with longer cable runs.  This cable is only 10 feet long and therefore is probably well within the length where any loss of signal strength is likely to be incurred.

For unamplified signals such as electric guitar, a lower guage high quality shielded cable is absolutely necessary, particularly if you are usinf a cable of 25 feet or more.

I then moved the router down to the middle floor and placed it near my tv, and the performance was greatly improved to the point where I was able to stream video. Even though the performance was improved, I would rather just stream video with a cable under most circumstances. The screen sharing resolution is also maxed out at 720p. Hopefully more content providers will make their own apps, which clearly perform better than the screen sharing.The Chromecast is nice for laptops/desktops and incredible for mobile devices. The ability to starting playing a video, then turn off your screen or start doing something else is not possible with just a hardwired connection (for mobile).There are a few things that I still haven't tested, such as multiple mobile devices queueing up a Youtube playlist, but overall for only $35 I highly recommend it.

I'm very happy with it so far.  I had purchased a new laptop recently with Linux Ubuntu installed.  After using the mouse pad for a while, I started to have pain in my wrist, so I decided to get an ergonomic mouse.

I find myself constantly babying the scroll wheel (which I use a lot--with my last mouse, my natural hand position at rest was with my index finger resting on the scroll wheel, but here I am conscious of trying not to touch it when not using it because it feels flimsy).  This doesn't mean it is actually flimsy or needs to be babied, it's just a psychological design thing, but that's important.(2) I paid $90+ for it, which makes me feel like somewhat of a sucker.

Well, I guess part of the reason is that I never owned a good pair of phones. I recently bought a pair ofSennheiser HD-595 Premier Headphone(here on Amazon), which are tight (see my review). The Senns have pretty high impedance (50 ohms), and my netbook and ipod don't have enough juice to power it. Therefore, the need for a headphone amp arose.One of the first HP amps that I came across was the FiiO F5. I had never heard of this brand. I think a reviewer mentioned that its Chinese. Anyhoo, The features that hooked me was its price, size(it's the same size as the iPod shuffle), and simplicity. Seeing a majority of positive reviews, I decided to go for it. I received it in 3 days from Head-Direct (which I would recommend since it was under $25 with shipping, and they use Amazon for payment).Upon first trial through my iPod, I was a little miffed because there was a high frequency ""noise"", is the best way I can describe it. But it went away when I played the music, and it never recurred. I played music with, and without the amp, and the difference is quite remarkable. With thew FiiO connected, aside from a big boost in volume, the depth is also enhanced. The bass boost is subtle, but noticable. I would recommend maxing out the volume on the amp and controlling the volume from the source, as the button is quite small and right next to the output plug.Other than the sound, the things I like about it is its size, internal rechargeable battery, on/off button, clip, and blue/red  light, which indicates when it is on/off or charging/charged. It also comes with a 6"" and 3' cord, and a USB to mini USB charging cable.The only things I can think of that I don't like is the fact that it charges through the computer, which means that, 1) you need access to a computer, and 2) the computer has to be on. I also find it a little disturbing that the instruction manual states that the battery can be charged and discharged hundreds of times, BUT the battery will eventually wear out and is irreplaceable. Hopefully, it will last 25 bucks worth of charges! Which brings me to question how long the charge will last. And since I just got it, I have yet to figure that out. Highly recommend it.",How does build quality work?,[],[],[],[],[]

I already have an Amazon Prime membership, mostly for quicker shipments.  But of course, with Prime, you also get a lot of free movies.Now, I'm not saying that the movies from THIS service are necessarily better than the movies from than THAT service -- there are probably more films available right now from THAT service for sure -- but, it is getting close enough that it was time to stop paying the seven bucks a month.But there was another issue.  I have a streaming box from, well, you know who.  Now, I really like their devices.  I have a phone, a tablet, and a streaming box from them (similar to Roku).  But they don't let you install apps on that device, and there is no pre-built app for Amazon's streaming service.  So, that required me to buy a new Roku box, which comes preloaded with an Amazon streaming app.  (No no.  Jailbreaking, even if it would work, is a horrific idea from a security standpoint.)I almost made the mistake of ordering the ""wrong"" Roku box from Amazon.  When I initially looked at the quick spec list, I was disappointed since it didn't appear to me that any of them had both wireless and wired Internet capabilities.  But luckily, I stuck with it and realized that the most expensive box was the ONLY one that had ethernet.  This is important to me because, while I have a wireless network, it is of course almost always better to connect your devices through wires, particularly through Gigabit ethernet, which I have throughout my house.The setup was relatively easy, although the hardest part:  getting the batteries in the remote!  The battery relase button must be pushed down; I have to say that I think that this is the first time I've ever seen this.  After that, it was just some quick registration with a couple of web sites to enable movie playback.First movie:  ""Marnie.""  Now, I reviewed that film on this site, and while I didn't completely like it (you may read my review to see why), the digital transfer was fantastic.  And it looked amazing through my new Roku box through HDMI to my 1080P Sharp Aquos.  (I know, I know.  I want a new 4K TV with 2160P, but they're WAYYY to expensive right now.)  And I have to say:  I actually like the UI in the Roku maybe a little better than the box from, err, that other company.  The remote on the Roku is a little more awkward though.A fairly strong recommendation here, particularly if you are in the same boat as I.",What is the receiver?,[],[],[],[],[]

Thepackage design was simple and clean. I enjoyed this kind of simple joy whenopening a new product, yet I think it's only possible when a companyprofoundly designs its packaging as well as its product; this makes it feel asif I am unveiling a mystery, and this gadget gave me this feeling!Here are the list of pros:Easy file transferring - just plugged it into USB port, and the new driveappeared on my desktop screen. Then I just dragged the files I wanted to copyout from the folder. I heard that there are some people having issues with themino's built in USB plug, but I did not have any issues. I even tried a coupleof different ports, and it worked flawlessly, although it seemed a bit heavyhanging the whole camcorder in my desktop's USB port (but it workednonetheless!). Things such as 4 port USB hub or USB extension cable wouldsolve the issue if necessary.Doesn't feel cheaply built - I love the brushed metal feel to it. It might bea bit heavier than other plastic camcorders, but it feels very nice when Ihold and shoot. The built quality is excellent and the whole unit feels quitesturdy.Compact - It fits perfectly even in my small hand, and I am still able tocontrol all the buttons in the back with my thumb. The size is smaller thanthe iPhone so the grip is very good to hold and shoot (and it shoots HD, whichthe iPhone does not).Touch sensitive buttons - very useful if I shoot outdoors, such as at thebeach or playground sandbox. There is no need to worry about sand graingetting stuck in between buttons and the body. And the touch sensitivity iswonderful.Basic accessories - It comes with a soft case and a wrist strap. The softcase is very useful when you carry it around.Bigger space and longer battery life - This camcorder is designed to shootlonger than the first generation mino HD; therefore, it has about 8GB ofmemory space and a 2 hour lasting battery life. It's more than enough memoryspace and battery life to shoot outdoor activities or events.HDMI out - It's kind of standard these days, so it's a handy feature when Iam anxious to watch the clips on the big screen tv. I simply connect directlyto the TV using a HDMI cable, and it works without any issues.Video quality - Typically, I would not expect a super amazing video qualityout of this tiny camcorder, but mino's 720p HD is more than what I expected.With good weather (enough light), the video quality is amazing, and I can'tcomplain, but under low lighting, I found the video quality disappointing.It's a common limitation of these type of small consumer camcorders, I think;therefore, I am not too surprised about this aspect.There is one thing I wish it came with:The lens cover - It would protect the lens from my kid and blocks dust whenit's not in use. There is, however, a protective glass (or transparent cover)built in, and I think it could be more practical, actually. I can just wipe itwith my finger or something quickly.Overall, this is the simplest and easiest HD camcorder. Settings are easy andthe control buttons are simple and self-explanatory. The only thing to worryabout is what to shoot. The price is worthy, and frankly speaking, I've beenquite content with the camera.",What is the main control of the console?,[],[],[],[],[]

It is very slim but at the same time very sturdy case.  The ipad clipped right on and the keyboard connected right away with the bluetooth.  I have only been using the case for about a week now but have very few issues.  The keyboard works great and looks good enough that people don't believe it's not a laptop until I show them.The keyboard itself is fairly light and I carry around my iPad almost full time with the keyboard and use it like my old netbook.  The keys work great and the only issue I've had is due to limited space the right shift key is smaller to make room for the up arrow.  I find myself hitting the up arrow a lot when going for the shift but it is something minor that with continued use is becoming less and less.  The battery life is also great.  I charged the keyboard the recommended 6 hours when I got it and I have not had to charge it yet (5 days as I use it to write this).The mount for the iPad itself is pretty simple and connect by simply squeezing together the tabs.  The biggest issue I have with the mount is the option to slide it in and out.  You have to slide the lock to move it out (move iPad away from you) but it slides in without the lock.  If you have it out and push or move the keyboard it has a tendency to move all the way back in.  Tilting back and forth is semi difficult also but that may be it is fairly new and will loosen up a bit with continued use.My only other con is a personal preference due to the fact I'm a pilot and use the iPad in the cockpit so it may not apply to you.  When I take the iPad off the keyboard before the flight I now have to find a place to safely store the keyboard.  It is rugged but I don't want to just throw it in my flight back and have items pressing on the keys.I have not tried it yet but it does appear the top case is actually thin enough to fit into other cases to be used as a pilot kneeboard.Overall I am very satisfied with this case.  I don't think you will find another hard case or keyboard combo that will compete with the NT38B anywhere near the price range.  I highly recommend it.,How are the results?,[],[],[],[],[]

We used to cart around jam boxes with mix tapes, but now our computers, smart phones, tablets and just about any internet connected device can access our online music library. The speakers on these devices are just horrible and sometimes, I don't want to have headphones on. I wanted a nice sounding small unit that would allow me to enjoy music anywhere from just about any device.The JAMBOX is small, easy to use, sounds very good for background music, is an excellent design and even runs on batteries.SIZE: this thing is very small, you can take it anywhere and tuck it away in a place where it almost disappears. All you get is music.DESIGN: These folks included a simple interface that uses only four buttons and voice feedback to tell you how to pair a device, charging status and much more. It comes with a manual, but honestly, you can set this up with no trouble out of the box. It is well constructed with a nice feel. It even looks good.BLUETOOTH CALLING: The bluetooth implementation works for sound and as a speakerphone. I was not purchasing this as a speakerphone but WOW, this things is great for conferencing as long as everyone is in front of it. Yes it has an integrated microphone. Rejection is very good, we could all clearly hear the caller and they could hear us as well.SOUND: The sound is actually very good for background music. You won't get big stereo sound field, excellent imaging, thumping bass or dance party volume levels -- but what you do get is actually quite impressive. The sound is balanced from top to bottom and is actually very natural. Acoustic music with vocals like James Taylor, Nora Jones or Shane Jackman are reproduced with excellent balance and clarity. Electronic pop music can lack the dynamics and extended bass, but the bass you do get is not boomy and sounds very natural. One more thing about the bass, it is actually amazing this little thing puts out as much bass as it does for the size. If you are worried the JAMBOX will not play loud, it will, just not THUMPING loud. Because of the smooth high end and good tonal response, you can listen to this thing for a long time with almost no fatigue.BLUETOOTH MUSIC: As most devices, the BlueTooth audio is not as good as if you use the 1/8 audio jack. If you want the best sound plug your phone or computer into this thing. It will amaze you. You may need to turn your headphone output down some so as not to overdrive the unit. It will get a little distorted. The BlueTooth sound is very good, just not as good as when using the plug. Jawbone does something very interesting with the BlueTooth audio. Some devices with BlueTooth audio can be overdriven with the audio output from the source and will distort in at the higher levels. I play guitar and some distortion is good, but not on prerecorded music. NO! The folks at JamBox know then and use something called compression to dynamically limit the amount of sound from your device to the JAMBOX when your BlueTooth level is to high. This compression can sound like 70's pop radio where all the dynamics form the music are taken out. if this bothers you, turn your device (phone/iPod/computer) BlueTooth volume down until the compression is eliminated then use the volume on the JAMBOX to adjust the sound. BUGE IMPROVEMENT.In summary, of the BT Speakers out, this one is the best value for me. Smaller than the Bose, sounds about as good, super easy to use and has MUCH better sound than the sub $100 solutions. If Steve Jobs were to design a BlueTooth portable music device, it would look like the JAMBOX.",How is the sound?,"['SOUND: The sound is actually very good for background music'

It took us a while to get the thing set up, entering account info and registering for the various services but connecting to my wireless network was relatively simple and the TV downloaded an important update right after initial connection was made. Pairing the remote required that I hold the remote pretty close to the hot spot on the lower right corner of the TV but once paired, it worked flawlessly.

I was very impressed with the built-in sound of this TV, clearly upgraded over previous models, but I picked up an audio Y-cable and connected the TV directly to my stereo receiver's tape deck 'in' port and now when I activate the receiver's 'Tape' button, I get crystal clear stereo sound to go with my amazing picture. Even though this system supports surround sound 5.1 I am not missing it. The 3D features of this TV are mind-blowing but it does give you a headache after a while; you can sense the flicker of the battery powered glasses. Not all 3D discs are equal, some are a let-down and despite the hype, you likely won't end up watching 3D programming very often. The 3D starter kit comes with 2 pair of glasses and there's a coupon to get two more pair for free by mail so at least it's not too expensive for everyone to get the taste of 3D when they want it. The 2D picture though is beyond incredible. The bezel is unbelievably thin and the TV itself is very very thin and relatively lightweight. Stand is heavy and stable; ports are clearly marked but there is very little room to plug in the HDMI cables at back, especially since the pro cable I got for the Blu-Ray has a magnetic shield barrel on the cable and this presses against the back of the TV and seems to slightly bend the port so it is better to use HDMI cables that lay flat.The Samsung apps work pretty well but they are clearly still young and need development. I spent nearly two years researching TVs and am very happy I got this Smart-TV model. Dynamic LED backlighting was a key feature for me, there is absolutely no flashlighting or ghosting, blacks are deep and solid. This is surely one of the best TVs out there right now and I would whole-heartedly recommend it.",How is it bezel?,['The bezel is unbelievably thin and the TV itself is very very thin'],[2529],[4],[0.925],[ True]

I try to download my material to my device so I can remove it from Cloud. I tried to use the Kindle Free time feature; but I couldn't keep up with all the apps she is downloading; we only have the purchase parential control on as all of the controls are very restricted.  What is the point in having the device if the child can use it.  She is 11 years old 5th grader on a 8th grade level. The family has spoken about internet safety with her and currently she is following the rules we have set. We have a very secure home network and have features with the network we have set up. Also have installed free app from Norton Security. Within the first 2 hours she was downloading free apps that allowed her to phone & text her friends without any adult instructions!

I have not gotten it professionally calibrated, I want to do that next month, but the picture still looks fantastic, both for 2D and 3D content (""The Avengers"" looks amazing!). Interestingly, I find myself using the THX-Cinema settings just as often, if not more often, than the custom settings I had generated using the various calibration discs. That may be more out of laziness than anything else, to be honest.A few things:1 - If you have a lamp or a window in your room that you think will reflect on the screen, be aware that the anti-glare coating will not cut it during the day. You'll need heavy drapes for the day and use a dimmer or just turn off the lamp at night.  It can be distracting.2 - My biggest frustration is that I am noticing some degree of line bleed, which I guess is a problem with plasmas in general -- I noticed it with my old Samsung but find myself noticing it a lot more with the GT50. I am very frustrated to have to report this to you all and I am going to see what I can do about it, if anything -- again, this is something that happens on all plasmas, apparently, I just wanted to make sure you all knew that I was finding it somewhat distracting.(Line bleeding is when a ""ghost"" version of another element on a screen actually appears on part of the screen where where it shouldn't  -- for example, a character's face might be in front of a window sill -- the ""ghost"" of the sill continues across the character's face.  There is some discussion of line bleed on the GT50 here:[...] )I am not going to change my star rating for my review based on what I am perceiving as a limitation of the technology (as opposed to the set) but it's something to keep in mind. I will be doing some research to see what, if anything, I can do to address the situation and let you know what happens.Finally, I have received a few email inquiring which kind of TV stand I have (in the pictures section). I got the stand in 2007 from IKEA -- sadly, I do not think they make it anymore. It's a pity, it's kind of a perfect TV stand.ORIGINAL REVIEWAfter six years, it was time to replace my aging 42"" Samsung plasma (during which a circuit board died, which ended up requiring an all new screen to be installed--thank goodness I had the extended warranty).  At first, I went with the UN55D8000, which was a good looking set, granted, but just didn't have the picture quality I wanted, so I ended up returning that less than a week after it arrived.  Then I heard about the new Panasonic models coming out, and realized that the GT50 looked like a promising candidate.I have had the TV for less than a week, and there is no way I am returning this incredible plasma television.  I will share some initial thoughts (and have submitted photos as well), and will update my comments later as a kind of progress report.If you care about picture quality and don't feel like waiting for the VT, look no further.  This set has one of the best pictures out of the box I have ever seen, with deep, silky blacks and vibrant (not never overly so) colors. My ""go-to"" test for black levels is the first scene of Episode 9 of the first season of ""Game of Thrones,"" which takes place entirely in the shadows. Quite frankly, I didn't know blu-ray could look so good. The details in the bricks and the clothing, all illuminated by a flickering torch, were astounding. There was a real sense of depth and clarity, even with this very dark scene--incredible.  I dialed in my own settings using the Spears and Munsil disc, but the settings included in the THX- Cinema mode worked really well and are a great starting point.The color controls for this TV are very extensive, and I think a professional calibrator could really make this set sing. I will get a real calibration done in a month and let you know how it goes. Suffice to say, once I dialed in the proper brightness and contrast and turned pretty much everything else off (and making sure to turn the ""panel brightness"" to low)--the set was great.I watched ""Tron"" in 3D using the Oppo BDP-93, and was very impressed with the 3D and the clarity of the picture. I don't have a lot of 3D content, so I will make sure to add more comments once I see more films. The glasses, which are not cheap, are light and quite comfortable, though it's annoying you are supposed to charge them via the TV--when the TV is on.  It would be nice if they came with little carrying cases or bags, but no such luck.I have DirecTV and the 1080i picture looks fantastic, as does the AppleTV's 1080p. It is with Blu-ray, however, that this set really feels most at home. I cannot overstate how rich the contrast is; my wife continues to comment on how much she notices the better picture, which is a great sign!I have this plugged into my sound system, so I haven't even heard the speakers, really, so I can't comment on the sound quality.As I illustrate in the pictures, the HDMI ports are very close to the side of the cabinet, so if you have thicker HDMI cables, you really need to coax them, gently, down the side so they don't poke out behind the set. I have a set of Bluejeans cables, which work just fine, but my Better Cables HDMI is definitely very close to the edge.  Speaking of cables, while the set does come with a cable stay, there is only 1 (though there are four places to put it)--Panasonic really needs to included another.The bezel is very thin and the set is not that much thicker than the Samsung LCD I had just a few weeks ago. I really like how it looks in the room.  The screen swivels about 10 either direction, which is nice. It's also much lighter than I thought it would be; I was able to put the stand on and lift it into place by myself (though, clearly, you should have someone help you--I was just excited).This is a really great set. I haven't seen the ST50, but I can't help but feel that the extra 24,000 shades of grey really push this TV to a higher level of picture quality. I am extremely, extremely pleased so far, and I am looking forward to putting it through its paces--and will let you know how it goes!Update (4/11/12):I started playing with the Internet Apps last night and wanted to add a few notes:1 - Every time I press ""Viera Tools"" or ""Internet"" I am kind of shocked how fast the interface comes up. This is, by far, the fastest interface I have ever used, thanks to the dual processor.  It's so fast that you start to get the feeling that you might actually USE the Internet on this thing!2 - Panasonic does have a web browser (App Store:LifeStyle) but it's a pain to download (you have to enter in your credit card information even though the application is free); I just wish it was included. I am going to fill out my credentials on the vieracast website because it's kind of annoying to enter in the data using the remote.3 - The YouTube interface is actually pretty nice. The text is displayed larger than on the AppleTV  and you can sort by HD Content only, which the AppleTV does NOT let you do--so that's very cool.4 - I still need to check out Netflix, Hulu +, Vudu and other applications. The GT50 offers a very comprehensive assortment of online services and, like I said, it's very easy and intuitive to get to.Other things:1 - Clicking on Viera Tools brings up a toolbar on the lower part of the screen from which you can access various items:- 3D options- THX options - basically, switch from THX Cinema to THX Bright Room and one other THX mode. Pretty good for testing out your custom settings with the THX ones.- Viera Connect - pretty much the same as pressing the ""Internet"" button on the remote- Media Player- DLNA - wasn't applicable to my system- Viera Link - not really sure what the difference is between Viera Connect and Viera Link; I will check it out and update this post- Eco - adjusts the auto-brightness features- eHelp - access to the 208 page manual via a specialized interface2 - There IS an iOS app (and I would assume an Android App) that can take the place of the supplied remote control. Useful, I guess, for Harmony users who may need specialized controls from time to time.  This seemed to work well for the most part but I have some thoughts:- The app makes ridiculous sounds when using the remote. You can turn the sounds off.  Really silly.- The trackpad controls are the default screen, but you cannot control the TV with them. You need to swipe to another pane to get to the arrow keys to navigate the menus. This was confusing at first and then just kind of irritating, because you have to go to one page to call up ""Options"" then swipe to another page to interact with the options.- The reason why I gave up entering my credentials to get the web browser was because the keyboard on the iOS app was NOT sending text to the TV. This is clearly a bug, but once it is fixed, this will work like the AppleTV, where you can use your iOS device to type into the TV, which is obviously much better than using the remote. Lame it's not working for me, though.- There is an iPad specific app which I have looked at but I haven't used with the TV (I don't know if it consolidate the various panes, will update).So, I dunno how important these services and Internet features are to you. I really like my AppleTV, so I already have most of them, but am curious to see Vudu's video quality and check out how Dolby Digital Plus sounds--I hope it works the Toslink output.  I personally will be using my iPad or Phone to deal with Facebook, twitter, etc -- even though image retention and burn-in are much less likely to be a problem on modern plasmas, I don't really feel like tempting fate with having a static web browser interface on the screen while I am surfing the web.hope this update helps!4/15/23 Quick updateTried the 3D. Here's what I got:1 - 2D-3D conversion was nothing to write home about. I didn't know if it was working half the time. Maybe I did something wrong, but it just gave me a headache.2 - Straight up 3D is awesome. Watched beginning of Hugo and found it hard to press ""Stop"". If you are into the 3D, you MAY want to get the 55"" for a more immersive experience, but the 50"" was fantastic, regardless. I still think the glasses make your eyes get tired, but still--the depth is really great, and the sense of immersion with ""floaty-bits"" was really top notch, at least in ""Hugo"".  Look, 3D might look brighter on the LED/LCD set I had before, but there was a sense of depth here that I felt lacking in the Samsung I tried out.3 - I have a few ""THX"" Blu-rays. I watched them in ""THX Cinema"" mode and they looked awesome. Maybe THX is not necessarily just hype?4 - Demo'ed the streaming services. Vudu's HDX format is no joke--it looks incredible, close (from my viewing distance) to Blu-ray, totally. HOWEVER, I could not get Dolby Digital Plus 7.1 (which is supposed to sound GREAT) output from the Toslink output on the TV. I am pretty sure DD+ requires HDMI, so that explains it. Still, DD+ includes the DD 5.1 mix and that sounded great. I was really impressed with the Vudo service and I think I will use it. Amazon and Netflix both looked great as well.  I still like the AppleTV UI, but this ain't half bad.Note: I talked to someone on the Panasonic ""Raise the Bar"" tour and she acknowledged that the iOS remote control app had some issues (the Android one is supposed to work fine) and that my problem (the keyboard not working) was going to be fixed soon. It was kind of cool that she knew about that.Finally, I put up some new photos showing a few off-axis viewing examples, a bird's eye view of the swivel angle, and some shots showing Vudu and Amazon content.thanks-m",What is the quality of the blacks of the screen?,[],[],[],[],[]

Especially switching back and fourth screens to switch from letter to numbers and other characters. This Keyboard Case had good and bad Amazon reviews. I took a chance and bought one. It works really well.  Keys are understandably smaller than a Standard Keyboard size, but functional. Can a good Typist smoothly type on this? Probably, but it is more for Hunt and Peck Typists like myself who seldom have both hands crowding the keyboard at the same time. Pros: Full Keyboard with individual Cut/Copy/and Paste buttons. And CD/DVD Play/Pause/FF/RR/Vol up/Vol down/Mute/Screen Brighter/Screen Dimmer/Home/and Search keys. Useful stuff. It has a left and a right Shift keys, BUT the right shift key is the same size as a standard letter key. That angered some reviewers. Me, I could care less cause I don't use that one anyhow.  It also has a DELETE key. BUT, it does not act like a Delete key. It does the exact same thing as the BACKSPACE key. Why they even included it if it wouldn't correctly Delete, is just wrongheaded. The complaints about the charging plugs for the keyboard and Ipad NOT fitting into their charging sockets when the case is closed doesn't apply to this model, because they DO both easily plug in when the case is closed. Trent must have modified the cutouts in the case to accommodate the plugs, because this no longer is an issue.  The Ipad instantly sleeps when the lid is closed so, no more shutting it off or turning it on. The Keyboard sleeps when not used for several minutes, and takes one or two key taps to awaken it again. On a single overnight charge, the keyboard lasts about 10-16 hours of heavy use, so, you need'nt charge it EVERY night for average daily couple hour keyboard usage.  I charge mine once every 4 or 5 days. A small green CHARGE light starts to flash, when it thinks it needs charging soon. Trent put this large CONNECT button on the top of the keyboard, as if it gets used often, but I only initially had to use it for it to find the Ipad. Haven't used it since. There is also a ON/Off switch, but I never use it, since the keyboard sleeps when not being used, and it uses very little juice while sleeping. There is even a Caps Lock LED at the top of the keyboard. It comes with a Key covering membrane sheet to protect the keys from coffee spills. It is removable, and easy to lose, so I don't use it.  I use a Stylus for Internet Browsing. The great thing about this case, is when you get ready to close it up, the track that the Ipad rested in, can now be used to store your stylus. The gap is wide enough to easily remove the stylus when ready.  The Keyboard Has up/down/left/right Arrow keys, but they don't scroll pages. But one thing they CAN do, unlike the Ipad keyboard, is simplify cursor movement left and right in a typed email or Document to correct spelling or typo errors. YAY. That alone is worth the price for this keyboard.  I highly recommend you put a screen protector film on your Ipad, and ditch the Keyboard membrane. It also supposedly protects the screen from the hard plastic keys when the case is closed, but a Screen Protector will do that, and no Membrane to lose. I also highly recommend you passcode protect the Ipad if you carry the case around a lot, here's why: When the case is closed and the Ipad if sleeping, and the keyboard is sleeping, if you squeeze the case, it presses down on the keyboard keys, which wakes up the Ipad and the Keyboard. The Keyboard gets bored after several minutes of no use, and goes back to sleep. But if the Ipad is not Passcode protected, it will remain on, and use battery juice. If it IS passcode protected, it will pop up a Passcode screen, and if you don't respond in 60 seconds, it goes back to sleep.  This is a really nice looking case. It has Leather-like accents. May be Leather, may not. Looks good. I get many compliments on this case. The Ipad part removes easily, for playing games, or reading ibooks. All Ipad Control buttons and camera are not obstructed by the case. I also recommend that if you are planning to use this case on a lap sitting in a chair, or in bed, get a lap table. One of those table like things with a Lap pad on the bottom, so the case has a flat, stable surface to rest on. Otherwise the Ipad will tip out of its Track in the keyboard case. There are 3 adjustable positions for Ipad tilt, to reduce overhead lighting glare.  For the price, this is a pretty good Product. It won't make your Ipad replace a Laptop Computer, but it outshines that dopey Touchscreen Keyboard that Apple forced us to use. And it is much cheaper, and better looking than the Keyboard case Apple sells.  Another thing I did, was buy the Yellow High-Glow Enlarged Keyboard Number/Letter stickers (from Amazon).  I had to trim every one down to fit, since they are for Standard sized Keys. But, in a very dark room I can now easily see the keys to type just from the glow of the Ipad screen at 3/4 Ipad brightness. Bigger, bolder letters and numbers.**** UPDATE 1 year later:  ****  This keyboard is starting to suck bigtime.  It double-strokes letters too often. And, too often, the letter keys I press while typing, do not register.  For some reason the Ipad spell check/correct does not work with this keyboard, so as I am typing along, I look back to see all the typing errors.  I am spending way too much time correcting, undetected typing errors.  Another thing,...when the keyboard was new, it was instantly recognized by the iPad. Nothing to initiate.  NOW, I have to go to settings in iPad, at startup, and manually connect the keyboard every time.  Also, the battery life of the keyboard after a full charge, is about 2 hours, before typing errors get really bad.There is no remaining charge time for the keyboard, so it's a crap shoot as to how much time is left, after standing by for any length of time.  I will be buying a better keyboard.",How is the case?,[],[],[],[],[]

This wireless headset is the most comfortable set of headphones, of any kind, that I've ever used.  It's a little odd looking, yes, but function and comfort are my priorities in this case.  In fact, I chose the white version because I want it to be obvious to those around me that I have headphones on, and I'm not ignoring them or talking to myself!  I can pull out one ear bud, if someone is speaking to me and I don't have to deal with a long tangled cord to retrieve it and pop it back into my ear.  This is one reason I like this design so much: the cords are short and easy to manage.Honestly, I don't get what the magnetic spots are about?  I only seat the earbuds in the little magnetic pods when I'm hanging them up to charge, if ever.The majority of the product sits around the back of your neck (if I'm wearing it right), so the weight is not on your head or ears, and you barely notice the thing is there at all.  I wear it around my neck,let the ear-buds dangle; when a call comes in, the headset vibrates, and I can quickly pop one or two of the buds in.  There is a button on the left side to answer/hangup. People on the other end tell me the sound is great, even when I'm in a noisy room, or on a windy patio.  The volume control is also on the left side, as is the on off toggle, and the charging port.  I like that this product comes with an actual plug-in AC cord, not another USB thing that needs a special adapter or computer to charge it. Also (I think) the port looks like a common generic mini-usb size, that should be easy to replace if you lose the original.  I hate all those propriety cords!I bought these mostly, so I could pair it with my iPad and watch TV or Movies, while in a room with others who don't care to listen to what I'm watching.  I can get up and walk away, wash some dishes and continue listening without being tethered by wired headphones.  It's especially nice for news shows, where you can keep following without even needing to see the visual at all.It was easy to pair up with my ipad or iphone.  Just turned on the bluetooth on my devices settings, the LG headphones appeared in the list, and I clicked ""connect.""  Within seconds, I heard a few little beeps in my ear, confirming the headset was connected.  The few times that it didn't connect right away, I simply flipped the on/off switch (on the left side of the headset)once or twice, and my device suddenly connected to it.The sound quality is just great for phone calls or listening to a TV show or Movie.  No interference issues whatsoever.  Nice and clear.  Love the controls right there on either side of your collarbone.I didn't get these to listen to music, or even make phone calls, but I like them so much that I use them for both of those functions quite often.  With regular headphones, I hate having to look at the screen and swipe/tap to pause, jump to the next song, or change the volume. Somehow I always accidentally tap something I didn't mean to! But I've discovered that I can control my iPhone without even looking at it, (repeat or jump to the next song) by using the controls on the headset.  FYI: the round button on the right side will Play/Pause music on your iphone/iPad even if you weren't already listening to music.  The rocker type control on the right side will jump forward/ repeat/ jump backward to the next song on the playlist, or in your music library.As far as the sound quality goes for music-listening:  eh. shrug. I'm not sure.  It's fine, is all I can say.  Not awesome.  Not tin-ey.  But I don't think they sound as good as my skull-candy earbuds for cranking up the music.  It's not what I bought these for, so I have no complaints.  I don't want to crank up anything when I'm wearing these, since I need to be aware of what is going on around me, when I'm watching my son, driving or shopping.  (Don't get all fired up now ... I rarely listen to music on headphones when I'm driving!  But I DO use them to hear driving directions from my iPhone, without having to turn down the car stereo, or bother other passengers in the car).I was pretty skeptical when I ordered the LG headset, but after using it for a few weeks now ... it's definitely a keeper.  I love them!  The only reason I didn't rate it five stars, is because the sound quality is fine, but it would be nice if it was great. But minus one star for the lousy instructions. I don't even remember if there was an instruction sheet provided.  But I do recall having to just wing-it and figure out the operation on my own.  FYI for those also wondering: Charge them up first, it doesn't take long.* LEFT SIDE: on/off swith, charging port, volume rocker and phone controls.* RIGHT SIDE: Music controls: Play/Pause Button.

Because this USB hub is self-powered, that means that each USB device is getting all the power it needs. Again, because this USB hub is self-powered, the computer does not need to be on to charge the USB devices! This hub supports both USB 1.1 (12Mbits/second) and USB 2.0 (480Mbits/second). Which is a good thing because, most USB devices now days require a 480Mbit connection, in order to get anything done in time.Because this hub is so small, the wires tend to want to yank it off of the desk. So I used my super man solution to everything electronics, double sided tape, YES! When the USB hub is all connected up, you will see green LED lights for the ports. It is a nice green glow that looks good, but not so bright to be annoying.CONCLUSION:  I like the color of the D-link hub, as it pretty much matches my SMC Baracade router. Having 7-ports in a USB hub is just an awesome thing, I love how fast the transfer rate is, and I love the green glowing port LED's. With it being self-powered, I no longer have to leave my computer on to charge a USB device. So far I have not had any problems with it, and I give this hub a 5 out of 5.",How was the power supply?,['super simple' 'the power to the hub'],[36 62],[2 2],[0.5119048 0.5119048],[ True  True]

I was able to find a factory refurb with a full warranty + included cables for about 15 bucks cheaper than the Roku 3 alone on Amazon. I'm using the money I saved to purchase an extended warranty. I love Amazon, but I recommend shopping around. I would have settled on the Roku 2 had I not found that deal! So, I basically paid a little over the price of a Roku 2 for a Roku 3 with cables, and once I buy the extended 2 year warranty, I'll have paid slightly more than a brand new Roku 3 with a weak 90 day warranty.Netflix became my main source of entertainment after I cut down on the amount of TV channels I have. Unfortunately, I rarely got to use Netflix after my good computer crashed. Since then, I've been operating an old nearly outdated laptop, and it works for most of my daily needs (social media, mostly) so I haven't felt the need to upgrade and replace it yet. However, it's had issues loading Netflix from time to time, so I began looking into streaming media players. That, plus the fact I have a nice flat screen I was gifted a couple Christmases back that's been going to waste. Why have a nice TV if all you can use it for is basic cable?Enter the Roku, the ideal option for someone who cares more about having content to watch (or listen to) than playing games or anything else. We have an Xbox in the living room which is fine and dandy, but I barely use it myself and it wasn't worth it to me to buy a gaming system for movies/TV alone when I could just buy a media player. Plus, the Roku does have some more simple games, like Angry Birds, which is really cool.Set up is simple, it boots up quickly and navigation is easy. If you have Netflix and Hulu you'll have more shows and movies than you could ever watch for under 20 bucks a month. I've been running the Hulu trial and will definitely be purchasing it when it runs out.I did have one issue where it locked up and reset itself already on day 1. I was worried that this was an issue because it was a refurb, but I did some investigative work and found out that it's a fairly common issue with Rokus and it's related to software, not hardware.I'm not too fussed about it, everything else is going fine, and if it becomes a recurring problem, well, that's what warranties are for.If you've got the extra money, the Roku 3 is great, though I was going to go with the 1 or 2 until I found a deal on the 3. I hear it has a better interface than the other models but I can't confirm, and there's also Youtube access, but that's said to be coming on the other models in the near future, so really, any Roku will serve the average consumer well! Just know that the 3 only has HDMI output option, so if you have an older TV, you'll need to go for the 1 or 2. You might be able to get it to work with an HDMI to analog converter, but I don't have firsthand experience with that.I don't know if it's worthy of the upgrade if you have another Roku, but if you're looking for a new one anyway and have the extra cash (as I said, if you look around you can get a refurb for cheaper with a fully warranty on a certain widely known competitor of Amazon), then I'd definitely get the Roku 3.",How do you like the tv?,['I cut down on the amount of TV channels'],[608],[1],[0.],[False]

From the perforated look rubberized area where your thumb rests to the brushed metal strips which arcs gracefully around the side of the mouse, to the low gloss plastic finish and the metal scroller wheel with rubber insert, it's a beautiful mouse, high quality mouse.It's extremely comfortable as well. Perhaps not quite as much as my old MX Revolution, but very close.Darkfield is extremely precise and works on every surface I've tried, from my shirt to my glass desk.This is the Cadillac CTS-V of mice.Battery is a removable and replaceable AA unit, a nice feature since internal battery failure caused the death of my MX Revolution.Charging is done via USB cable, so no down time.Battery life on its first full day of use is excellent, still 3 bars after hours of use.Have a middle mouse button again! Now shifting between the wheel modes is done via dedicated button.Nifty little travel casePlenty of programmablity.Cons: Cons are only a few.Forward/back/zoom buttons don't quite fall into reach as naturally as they did on the MX Revolution.Loss of shift-to-click. I'll miss this feature. Loved how the MX Revolution could be programed to switch from geared to free spin depending on how fast the wheel spun, then would switch back.Other Thoughts: My dear MX Revolution bit the dust on me a few weeks ago, due to internal battery failure, yet despite buying the original four years ago, Logitech replaced it with the new model.It's really worth saying that their customer support is superb, friendly, and helpful. They also send you return shipping labels now so you don't have to pay for shipping. Now that's progress. Turnaround was about 2 weeks total. I will continue to buy products from Logitech, they stand behind them.My only other minor complaint is the Application Switcher. I don't care for it...distorts the windows and when many are up it looks cluttered. But that's just a keystroke assignment away to set it back to Document Flip, so it's not an issue.Overall I love this mouse so far, and while I do miss my MX Revolution, this is a worthy successor. It's even better looking and very nearly as comfortable, very precise and works on surfaces the old mouse never could.Hopefully it will last!",Where is battery ?,"['Battery is a removable and replaceable AA unit'

Yes it is a good camera, and yes it will satisfy most first time SLR users needs. BUT BE WARNED, if you are planing to get serious there are better choices out there! I originally stated that I was able to shoot a number of sports (soccer, hockey, rugby) with no trouble, and I still stand by that. However even a couple hundred more dollars will get you the 30D and in my opinion its a way better deal. Its not quite as easy to use button and menu wise, but thats something you can get used to!

I just recently used the 30D with the 70-200 f/4L for a collegiate soccer game and let me tell you the difference was amazing. Compared to the xti and 70-200 the AF was way way faster. It made all the difference, and  a lot more of my shots came out useable. If you have the extra money I would highly recommend the 30D over the xti. Ultimately go hold them both, but the 30D just feels better and more solid. If your shooting an elementary school game the xti is great, but if your planning on doing anything semi serious the extra couple hundred is worth it.

Compact, HD video and stills, and Wi-Fi connectivity to convenient sharing sites.There is good and bad.I originally felt there was a lot more BAD with this camera, but after additional testing I have given this camera a better rating.At this time the Bloggie cannot connect to Facebook: Trying to do so takes the user to a SONY web page that informs you that the Facebook upload service is temporarily not working and will not be available ""until December"". (Note, I am writing this in March.) The SONY rep I spoke with says they are currently working on this issue and the December Date is not realistic. He believes it will be corrected in the next couple of weeks. I have to mention, that Sony's customer service did help me through a few the problems I was having with set-up and function. This made the difference between me returning the camera and keeping it.Connecting and Uploading to my I-phone via wi-fi is a little touchy. When it works; it works fine. There are times when I am in areas that something, in the air, blocks the signal between the two devices. When it works this is a convenient feature. I bought this camera so I would not tax my I-phone with home video file bloat. It's nice to be able to grab a picture from the Bloggie via wi-fi and then edit the image using one the photo editing apps I have on my I-phone.Uploading to You-tube worked. I didn't run into any problems uploading a video to You-Tube and video appeared on the site in a minute.Connecting to Playmemories, the Sony photo/video upload site, worked well. The connection to the site was not always solid and uploaded images dropped about 25% of the times I tried. I can't tell if this is a wi-fi problem or a problem with the Playmemories site. Maybe I am missing a control feature, but I noticed that ALL photos and Videos upload to the site upon connecting. I would prefer that it allowed me to check images and videos for uploading.Recording LIVE video to the QIK web site, after an account is set up, worked really well. I was actually impressed at how easy this was.At first I was really disappointed in the fact that the focus ring creates a tapping noise that can be heard on the video. After additional testing I have found that the condenser mic hears this woodpecker-tapping sound when there is no other sound in the room. The mic opens up and listens for sound and the sound it picks up is the focus mechanism. I noticed that the tapping sound was not loud when other sounds were in the room. Considering I am using this movie for blogging and home vacation home movies, this tapping is no longer much of a bother to me.The video is very clear. The focus function is slow to react to subject distance changes. I would suggest setting up a shot if you can, tap the screen so the camera focuses on your subject and then start recording.At another Amazon customer's suggestion, I tested the recording length time:In HD, the camera stayed in record mode for 24 1/2 minutes before it stopped recording. It does not automatically start recording another file. You have to start a new recording manually. This isn't a problem for home movie recording, but it would be a problem if you're recording a performance, play, musical event or other lengthy topic where you would want the camera to keep rolling. If this is your need, get a bigger camera.While recording video you can press the snapshot button on the top of the camera and get some nice still-shots on the fly. I really liked this feature.The images are crisp but I feel the shutter speed is a little slow so, if your subject is moving, expect a little blurring.I used kept this camera in my pocket over the last few days and really used it. I recorded indoors and outdoors and, despite a few out-of-focus shots, I really got some nice clean, crisp video that I'm happy with.I wish SONY had allowed for a memory bump via a card slot.After getting the camera set-up on my computer, connection and image upload has been really easy. The files are compatible with all of my video editing programs and the video looks really nice when it's burned to DVD.For the money I spent, I couldn't find anything else on the market that offered what this camera does.",How are battery?,[],[],[],[],[]

Its not too big neither too small the size is just the proper one.

Also the pockets are very helpful and the straps to hold a tripod seems to hold well a tripod there. Also is very comfortable to wear it. However if you have a lot of stuff you might need something bigger, for me works fine since I don't have to many this to carry there yet (1 DSLR, Kit lens, 1 remote, 1 charger, the cables, lens cleaning kit, sometimes cell phone, etc).",How is the strap?,[],[],[],[],[]

Well now on to the review. As many other reviewers have noted, this camera is not perfect - yes, the pictures do look blurry at pixel level, the noise reduction is heavy handed, the battery takes a while to charge, the GPS is a bit slow, the flash is a bit overpowering at times and a point  I would like to note - the lens wobbles - yes, if you touch it while it is extended you will see that it has quite a bit of lateral play - don't worry it won't fall off :-). But even after all these common gripes, this is a pocket full of fun - for all you photographers out there - this camera can truly keep you entertained for months on end.This finally replaces my all time favorite P&S; - the Fuji F30 that has been traveling in my backpack nonstop for 5+ years. No, I am not disposing the F30 - I have not found a single P&S; to date that can best the low light performance and I am keeping it till the day it dies out on me.Back to the HX9V. I have only one advise for serious shooters - please do not shy away from using the scene modes and the iAuto and Superior Auto modes ... yes, it is fun to tweak the shutter speed / aperture / iso etc. in the manual and program modes. However, do remember that the best photos that you will get is when you allow the camera to do it's electronic magic on the picture processing - so while  manual modes make us happy to be in control, it is the auto modes that gets you the best shots!Before I finally zeroed down on the HX9V, I did consider both the Nikon S9100 and the Canon 230 - the Nikon lost out owing to the slightly inferior image stabilization and the Canon owing to the slightly narrower lens (28mm versus 24mm on the Sony). I am sure those two are great products as well, but to me the extended feature set of the Sony were just too compelling. And it does take very nice photos in every lighting condition that you can imagine. As you can imagine, daylight shots are a snap for this camera ... if you want to challenge it, try a low light landscape shot at 100 ISO on a tripod - the results will blow you away. Not carrying a tripod? Set it to Superior Auto and shoot hand held for a very nice result that will look great on a 8"" x 10"" print.And of course for everyone interested in shooting HD Video - this is just the best one out there now - period. It replaces my Flip UltraHD - that used to take great videos but the Sony with it's optical zoom, stereo sound AND optical image stabilization while shooting Video is just too good.Don't hesitate - this one is a winner!",How is the photo?,[],[],[],[],[]

I can listen to these for an hour or so. Then I find my ears feel hot and these headphones are pressing my ears. Then again I am spoiled by the comfort and lightness of the bose OE2 which has become my default over the ear headphones of choice.So if you like bass, ad are used to over the ear headphones that are of a tight fit, you will likely love these.

These are actually my first IPS and I can say I am simply amazed and the picture. Before I go on let me post my settings because out of the box settings are the WORST and will make you want to return the item.Splendid: TheaterSharpness: 45Trace Free: 80ASCR: ONBrightness: 90Contrast: 78Saturation: 70Color Temp: User Mode with all colors maxedSkin Tone: NaturalSmart View: OffWith those settings everything should look great IMO. I actually bought 3 monitors because I am running SLI configuration for programming and for gaming. Because I have such a small desk, at the moment, I had to angle the monitors 75 degrees from the center monitor.  So if you can picture that in your mind, I want to say I have NO problem seeing anything. The colors still look great and gaming is just as fun. Only problem (this is not the monitors fault) is my head hurts from turning lol, just wanted to share that :PSome might ask if the 21 inch is too small. I can say I was worried about this too because I was using my PS3 3d display beforehand and can say that text is a fraction of a bit smaller. Unless you have really bad eyes, these monitors are perfect size. I also like the size because I have heard the bigger you go, the more you can see the LED backlight. In my case I can say on a totally black screen I see MINOR backlighting; nothing that would make the screen look awful, don't let that turn you away from the monitor.Some reviewers have had bad outcomes with dead pixels and what not, I bought 3. Not one of them has had any problem except for user error. This user error was I thought all 3 monitors were dead because when I ""touched"" the power button it didn't respond. Don't fall victim like I did, the power button is under the screen, it is not a fancy touch sensitive button like I thought, again user error. You have plenty of connection options except display port but that is alright because I prefer DVI and HDMI so it really is user preference. No speakers but again doesn't bother me, I use a headset. Lastly, the design is sleek but the stand feels cheap. Just touching the monitor a little and you will notice a bouncing effect (monitor rocks back and forth). This could have been made better but I don't plan on moving them or touching them so not a big deal breaker.So overall I am very happy with the purchase. The picture looks great at all angles, the frame rate if perfect (even for hardcore gaming, tested BF3 with ultra-settings, SLI 670s, and all three monitors in surround mode and it was PERFECT/BREATHTAKING), and the price couldn't be any more appealing for IPS. You will easily tell the difference from TN to IPS and you will never go back. Thank you for reading the review, if you would like to know more and any questions PLEASE leave a comment. I tend to check my amazon comments often and will do what I can to better help you.Posted pictures, comment if you need more or anything else. I also want to update that the first thing I did when I got these monitors was run over to YouTube and play a Dead Pixel Color Test. This allowed me to check every pixel and confirmed that all 3 monitors were flawless.",What about color ?,['The colors still look great'],[781],[1],[0.75],[ True]
